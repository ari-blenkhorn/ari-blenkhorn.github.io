<H1>Skydiving</H1> 
<center><i>This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!</i><br>
Buzz Lightyear, "Toy Story"
</center>
<p>
I've been skydiving since May 1997.

I learned to jump at <A HREF="http://members.aol.com/OBZrocks/JTW.htm">
J.T. Willie Airport</A> (aka The Farm) in Worthington, PA, and <A
HREF="http://www.clevelandparachute.com">Cleveland Sport
Parachute Center</A> in Parkman, OH.
My first jump was a static-line jump from a Cessna at 3200 feet. 
I had gone through a six-hour training session the week before, but
I couldn't
jump the day of the training because of the weather:  51-mph winds, rain,
hail, lightning...  The instructors had to shout to be heard over the
noise of hailstones on the metal hangar roof!  So I had a week to think
about it and get nervous.  But when the weather cleared up, 
I jumped... and once I'd tried it,
I was hooked.  Recently I've been working toward my static-line JM
rating, so I can help other poor suckers, err, students get hooked on
this too.
<p>
Usually I jump at the
<A HREF="http://www.parachutecenter.com"> Parachute Center</A>
in Lodi, CA.  Now'n'then I visit <a href="http://www.bayareaskydiving.com">
Bay Area Skydiving</a> in Byron, and
<a href="http://www.skydivemontereybay.com">Skydive Monterey Bay</a>.
<p>
Some unusual jumps:
<ul>
<li> from a hot-air balloon (at Skydive Arizona during the 1998-99 holiday
boogie)
<li> a midnight New Year's Eve jump from the DC-3 (same)
<li> the midnight "Millennium Jump" from Mike Mullins's KingAir (at Coolidge,
Dec 31 1999 - Jan 1 2000, of course) 
</ul>

<h3>Skydiving Quotes</H3>
I never ever thought I'd be putting a quote from Snuffy on my web page, but
this one got to me:<br>
<em>Skydiving is Tribal, take care 
of each other. Even the death of a non-lic.
papoose hurts the tribe. Brings to mind
a Chinaman word thut the Marine's luv.
"GUNG HO" = Work together</em>

<H1>Juggling</H1> I learned how to juggle in 1989, and since then I've
been learning various 3-ball (and recently, 3-club) tricks and patterns.
I've juggled with someone when we were both on stilts, and with big
groups (hey <A HREF="http://www.clark.net/pub/zilla/">Liz</A>: LADYBUG!).
<P>

I'm always looking to learn new juggling tricks.  I learned to juggle
clubs in April '97.  The IJA 50th anniversary festival (August 1997)
was very helpful.  I only went for two days, but you can learn a lot in two
days of non-stop juggling!

<P>
Stuff I can do:
<UL>
<LI>Mills Mess (beanbags)
<LI>cigar-box patterns with beanbags
<LI>passing 6 and 7 beanbags
<LI>passing 6 beanbags with varying-speed patterns
<LI>passing 6 clubs
<LI>front and side stealing (I'm too darn short to steal from behind!)
<LI>blind juggling
</UL>
<p>
Stuff I'm working on:
<UL>
<LI>basic rings
<LI>3-club tricks
<LI>variants of 3-bag columns
<LI>That Hat Thing -- does it have a name?<br>
    A side-steal-plus-hat-exchange routine with beanbags.
</UL>

I own a diabolo and a unicycle, but can't do much with either one
yet.

<H1>Other things I do for fun</H1>
<H3>Theater</H3>
Although I haven't had time for student theatre in grad school
(understatement!), I was very involved as an undergrad with the <A
HREF="http://www.jhu.edu/~news_info/homepage/">Johns Hopkins
University</A>
 <A HREF="http://jhuvms.hcf.jhu.edu/~barnstrm/home.html">Barnstormers</A>. I was a director, producer,
techie, set designer, stage manager, costumer, etc.  I've been on
stage occasionally but prefer not to.  My interest in costumes has
extended to Masquerades (Costumers' Guild competitions) and (briefly)
the
<A HREF="http://www2.ecst.csuchico.edu/~rodmur/sca/sca.html"> 
Society for Creative Anachronism</A>. Some <A HREF="costumeIndex.html">photographs</A> of costumes I've designed.<P>

<H3>Embroidery & Sewing</H3> 

I do a lot of cross-stitch and other needlework, mostly from my own
designs.  I've even sold some of my work, as part of an enterprise
called Digital Dragon Designs, but D<SUP>3</SUP> has been on hold for a few
years.  Graduate school doesn't leave time to do enough needlework to
make a business out of it!<P>

When I finish the current cross-stitch project I might try making
another quilt.  The first one, a 25th anniversary gift for my parents,
took almost five years, working on-and-off.  Important safety tip: for
your very first quilt, do something small.  Don't try to fit a
California king size bed (bigger than standard king size)!
<p>
I learned to crochet a few months back and have been working on 
small projects, like baby blankets for friends' kids.
<H3>Hiking</H3>

Now that I've escaped the frozen wasteland of Pittsburgh winter and moved
to California, hiking is eating up nearly all the weekend time that skydiving
doesn't absorb.
<P>
Memorable trips:<P>

January 1997: a week in Maui.  Walking through a dim green bamboo
forest, then breaking through into the sunlight and a magnificent view
of a huge waterfall... skidding down a hillside of lava chunks in a
volcano crater at 10,000 feet... picking my way across a crazily
eroded landscape of sharp rocks to a cove with a hidden
blowhole... camping by the edge of a cliff where fist-size crabs
scamper around the rocks below and the waves crash furiously all
night...
<p>
October 1997: a week in Banff.  Okay, so most of it was spent at a
conference, but only <i>most</i> of it.  I saw a black bear (on the
opposite side of a river), a wolf, many elk, magpies...  <BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/bricker/uist.html">PHOTOS</A>
<p>
June 1998: up & down the East Peak of Mt. Tamalpais, via the Indian Fire Road
and Eldridge Grade.
<p>
October 1999:  a day hike up & down Mt. Tallac (near Lake Tahoe) turned
into an all-night adventure, including a few hours huddled in a "nest" in
the bushes, soaking wet, trying to find a comfortable way to sleep
on the branches without getting speared.
I don't recommend descending the north side
of the mountain during warm weather!
