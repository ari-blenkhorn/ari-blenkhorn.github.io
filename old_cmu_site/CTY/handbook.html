<H1>CTY Math Coordinator's Handbook</H1>

1st version completed 4/94, distributed to math coordinators at all
CTY summer program sites. <P>

The handbook is intended to make the job of math coordinator less
overwhelming, by providing both a chronological checklist and an
explanation of the way things actually get done.  What is SUPPOSED to
happen is already well documented; the whole purpose of writing this
thing was to tell what REALLY happens, because that's what the
coordinator has to deal with.
