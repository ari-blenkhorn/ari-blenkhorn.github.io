<H1>CTY Math Coordinator's Handbook</H1>
<HR>

<H1>Introduction</H1>

The CTY math staff is a very close, family-like group, and a large
number of staff members return year after year. This makes it possible
for many of the important details of the mechanics of CTY math to be
passed along informally, as a sort of "apprenticeship" which occurs
during the course of the summers. Usually, this works beautifully,
because most instructors have been TAs, and most coordinators have
been instructors. However, when someone lacking this experience is
hired as a math coordinator (as has happened a few times), there is no
single, comprehensive information source which this person can use as
a guide. The pre-calculus instructor's handbook does not cover many
aspects of the coordinator's job, and the coordinator's job
description is not sufficiently specific. The new coordinator must
repeat, in only a few days, the development of methods and ideas that
previous math coordinators have already worked out over the course of
several years. This is clearly not an efficient training technique!
<P>
To help new coordinators manage this uncomfortable situation, this
handbook gives a detailed explanation of the activities,
responsibilities, and overall role of the CTY math coordinator. It
discusses some of the major decisions that a coordinator will have to
make, and points out aspects of the job which may vary from site to
site. Topics are organized by the time period in which they occur.
<P>
The handbook is pretty useful as a checklist for the experienced
coordinator, as well. After all, there's a lot of stuff to remember!
<P>

<H2>Authors</H2>

The Math Coordinator's Handbook was written by Ari Rapkin, with help
and suggestions from Martha Meadows, Mike Brandstein, and Shermann
Min. Collectively, their experience as math coordinators spans five
CTY sites and a total of nearly twenty years.

<HR>
<H1>Beginning of summer</H1>

<H2>Placement testing materials</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Make sure there are enough ADT's, scantrons, pencils, scrap paper,
  and scoring keys.  Get a timer or a watch with a second hand.
</UL>

<H2>Progress checklists, HSST's & keys, textbooks and curriculum spirals</H2> 

<UL>
<LI> If any are missing, have them sent from the central office. Make 
  sure there are a reasonable number of each.
</UL>

<H2>Math office</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Find a convenient place to keep testing materials and extra or
  shared resources.  Remember that tests and valuable things
  (e.g. graphing calculators) need to be kept secure. Suggested
  places: coordinator's classroom, the math staff's house/dorm, or an
  office.
</UL>

<H2>Study hall policy</H2>

<UL>
<LI> This is an annual source of confusion. Sometimes the site-wide
  studyhall format or location just isn't appropriate for pre-calc,
  and the math coordinator has to point this out to the site director
  and say "Let's do this differently.". There are several possible
  ways to conduct the pre-calc study hall: in dorm rooms, in dorm
  lounges, in classrooms, in lecture halls, etc. I'm not going to make
  a specific recommendation.  Instead, here are pros & cons: <P>

<UL>
<LI> General stuff: Seven hours a day in the same classroom is a long
  time, and the students enjoy a change of scenery (as do the
  staff!). Unfortunately, holding study hall anywhere but the regular
  classroom building means everyone -- staff and students -- has to
  carry their stuff back and forth every day. Of course, if you're at
  a commuter site, the students are stuck with this scenario
  anyhow. Also, few places are as well designed for studying as a
  classroom. Dorm-room desks may come close, but lecture hall desks
  are often too small and lounges are simply not on: they're generally
  poorly lit and not furnished with writing surfaces. <P>

<LI> Dorm rooms: This is the only study-hall location which allows the
  students to use their computers. However, distractions abound
  (including those same computers), and there aren't enough
  math-staffers or teacher's editions to go around. It's a nuisance
  for the staff to have to trudge from dorm to dorm with a heavy load
  of books and folders.  Finally, there's no good way to handle
  evening testing: if you allow testing during study hall, then you
  have to assign a math staffer to proctor the student(s) in an office
  or dorm lounge, or else impose on the RA to act as a proctor. <P>

<LI> Dorm lounges: The whole class is in one place, so the instructor &
  TA don't have to run a marathon each evening. Unfortunately, other
  classes have discovered these benefits, so there may be contention
  for lounges. There's probably a TV and a soda machine to act as
  distractions. Some lounges are so close to student rooms that they
  cannot be used if the rooms' residents are present. Also, since the
  lounge is by definition a casual place, the students feel less bound
  by rules of classroom behavior. <P>

<LI> Lecture halls: If the lecture hall is big enough, more than one
  class can share it. This is good because the staff members can split
  duties & resources and keep an eye on each others' students, but bad
  because the large number of students is harder to control (and
  lecture halls tend to echo). <P>

<LI> Classrooms: Seven hours a day in the same classroom is too much, but
  this can be adjusted by holding study hall in a different
  classroom. If it's in the same building, then everyone can leave
  their stuff in their regular classroom during the afternoon and
  overnight. This helps the staff be aware of students who are
  spending all their free time studying -- they're the ones who take
  their books home. <P>
</UL>
</UL>

<H2>Post-testing policy</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Another annual source of confusion: do we allow the students to take
  HSST's and/or finals after classes are officially over? The possible
  times include: during the last afternoon (when they're supposed to
  be packing), the dance that night, or the morning they leave. There
  are pros and cons to every one of these, and they're very site-
  dependent because each site schedules its end-of-session activities
  differently. Choose for yourself. (Consult with the other
  administrative folks, of course.) What's most important is that you
  choose early, and see that everyone knows the policy so that
  confusion doesn't arise at the end of the session.
</UL>
 
<H2>Math staff orientation</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Take some time during staff orientation to make sure that all the
  math folks get to know each other. Go do something fun together.
  (Mandatory Fun! ... and it's your last chance to get off campus)

<LI> This schedule is straight from the 1992 job description. Alter the
  timing as appropriate to your site's orientation schedule. <P>

<UL>
<LI> Thursday evening: Meet, explore each other's experience and areas of
  strength.  Decide who will work with whom and what courses they will
  teach (see below for more on this. It can -- and I think should --be
  put off until everyone's had a day or two to get familiarized with
  each other and CTY). <P>

<LI> Friday afternoon: Discuss the history and philosophy of CTY
  pre-calc. Share past experiences about students and their abilities,
  instructors and their attitudes toward math and teaching, and the
  nature of a CTY class. <P>

<LI> Saturday morning: Focus on pragmatic issues: how to administer a
  class, where to start students, flexible pacing, appropriate
  questioning, appropriate progress, and assessment. <P>
</UL>
</UL>
 
<H2>Study skills workshop</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Many students have never needed to develop good study skills, and so
  have an especially difficult time with a self-paced course. Try to
  arrange with the academic counsellor to offer math study skills
  workshops. It's useful to have a completely optional one during the
  first week and another during the second week which you can require
  that specific students attend.

<LI> Emphasize to the math staff the importance of paying close attention
  to the students' study habits, and taking action right away when a
  problem is noticed.
</UL>
 
<H2>Mattababy</H2>

<UL>
<LI> The CTY math staff email network. Okay, most of the school-year
  traffic concerns The Simpsons or sumo, but if you want fast answers
  from a whole bunch of long-time CTY math staffers, this is the place
  to ask. During the course of the summer, a lot of useful information
  goes back and forth.
</UL>

<HR>
<H1>Before (or at the start of) each session</H1>

<H2>Math questionnaires</H2>

<UL>
<LI> These may be available several days in advance if you're at a
  Baltimore site. If not, you probably won't have them in your hands
  for very long before the kids arrive. In any case, take the time to
  sort through these -- get other math folks to help! -- and determine
  how many Regents or other Unified-Math students you have, how many
  geometry-only requests, and a rough estimate of the counts for each
  subject. It's hard to tell who needs what with the trig-plus
  courses, but there aren't generally very many students that advanced
  so they'll end up in the same classroom anyhow.

<LI> If you're really ambitious, generate a list of pre-calc students for
  whom you're missing questionnaires (or whose information is
  unclear). Then flag their registration packets so that you can have
  them fill out questionnaires when they check in. This requires some
  coordination with whoever's organizing registration, but it's worth
  the effort. If you try to get this information after the parents
  have gone home, your success rate will be much lower.
</UL>

<H2>Who teaches what</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Once you've looked through the questionnaires, you can make a
  tentative decision about how many sections of each pre-calc course
  you're going to need. Ask your instructors and TAs what they'd like
  to teach and who'd like to work together, then try to match up their
  requests with what you need. You'll probably have to do some
  shuffling after the placement testing, but with luck most of your
  tentative plans will hold. Then you can distribute course materials
  and make up class lists, student folders, etc.

<LI> It's helpful to pair new staff members with experienced ones. Trying
  for gender balance is good too, since we're supposed to be role models
  for the students to identify with.  Don't put a great deal of effort
  into this, though. Pairing people with course content is much more
  important.
</UL>
 
<H2>RAs and dorms</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Find out who the math RAs are. Introduce yourself to them, and check
  that they know the plans for study hall. Make sure the instructors
  (and TA's, if possible) meet at least their own RAs, if not all of
  them. Find out which dorms the math kids are in. If you're going to
  be holding study hall in dorms, get keys to those dorms.

<LI> Some math RAs are quite comfortable with math, and are willing or
  even eager to help their students with their work, answer questions
  during class visits, etc. This is delightful when it happens, and
  worth encouraging. On the other hand, be alert to RAs who are not so
  mathematically inclined. Reassure them that this sort of
  participation is entirely voluntary, and there will be no negative
  consequences if they opt not to.
</UL>
 
<H2>Course materials and progress records</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Make sure that the instructors have progress chart masters, and the
  appropriate textbooks, curriculum spirals, progress checklists, and
  supplementary materials. Make sure that they know where the rest of
  these materials are kept.
</UL>
 
<H2>Classrooms</H2>

<UL>
<LI> See that the instructors know which classrooms they have and get the
  keys. Find out which keys open which other classrooms. (The ability to
  swap keys can come in very handy, especially if the TAs don't have
  their own keys.) If there are multiple classes using the same
  resources (e.g., two rooms of Algebra II) try to assign them to
  nearby rooms. Also, if there's an extra classroom nearby, try to get
  it for use as a testing room.

<LI> Go to the classrooms (with the other instructors, if possible) and
  make sure that everything is set up and working. Rearrange
  furniture, put up posters, try out the overhead projector,
  etc. There may be restrictions on what you can do to the rooms, so
  check first. (For example, at Dickinson you can't take extra
  furniture out of the rooms.)
</UL>
 
<H2>Parent/student orientation</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Be on hand during as much of orientation as possible, because some
  parents will be in a hurry and unable to stay until the official
  question-&-answer time, and since they don't know who's going to be
  their child's instructor they'll all want to talk to YOU. Keep a
  notebook handy, since you'll get a lot of placement info from
  parents. Don't promise a specific placement or instructor, make
  overly glowing assurances about how much work the student will
  finish, etc.; if the parents ask these things, explain the placement
  testing process and repeat the words "self-paced instruction" as
  necessary. If they ask about residential things, answer what you can
  but feel free to direct them to the residential dean or someone else
  who really knows these things.

<LI> At some sites, the math coordinator talks to the pre-calc parents
  separately after the all-parents welcome speech. This gives you a
  chance to introduce the math staff, give a little history of the
  math program, describe day-to-day events and the rigors of the
  program, explain what we expect from students and from parents,
  etc. This is a good time to talk some more about the meta-learning
  that's going on: even if a kid doesn't finish trig, he or she has
  learned a good deal about how to learn. Try to keep this speech short,
  especially at residential sites, because the parents are anxious to
  get back on the road for the many-hour drive home.

<LI> In your conversations with parents, and in your speech if you give
  one, stress the importance of making plans with schools now, instead
  of waiting until the student comes home or worse, until
  September. Emphasize the importance of being supportive, but not
  overly demanding. Point out that not finishing a year's worth of
  work does not mean that the student failed.

<LI> Every session, there are a small number of parents who didn't read
  the course description and are just now discovering that pre-calc is
  not a group-activity or lecture course. Describe the interactive
  things we do (extra problems, small-group lectures, students studying
  together) and if they're still not happy send them to an
  administrator.  There's no need to apologize for providing exactly
  what was offered.
</UL>
 
<H2>Placement testing (ADT's)</H2>

<UL>
<LI> When, where, and how the testing happens is really
  site-dependent. Whether or not there's a Scantron machine to do the
  scoring is also unpredictable (but "no" is the safer guess). If not,
  making plastic stencils to go over the Scantron forms speeds things
  up a lot.

<LI> Once you've got the tests scored, it's time to match scantrons with
  questionnaires, and assign kids to classes. This is known as "The
  Party Game", and usually CTY will spring for pizza and sodas, for
  sustenance while you tackle this administrative nightmare. Pull all
  the Geometry kids' scantrons right away (this is why you sorted out
  their questionnaires earlier!) since their class assignments are
  independent of their ADT scores. Make sure none of them have really
  atrocious scores. If any do, they're candidates for an algebra
  review before beginning Geo. Then split up the rest of the bunch
  based on ADT scores, school history & plans, Regents/Unified, and your
  innate good judgment. :-)
</UL>
 
<HR>
<H1>During each session</H1>

<H2>Progress records</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Make sure everyone is keeping thorough, detailed records of what the
  students are doing -- strong areas as well as weak. Checklists can
  wait, but it wouldn't hurt to update them weekly.
</UL>
 
<H2>Math staff meetings</H2>

<UL>
<LI> This can be completely informal -- e.g., a chat over lunch -- or you
  can schedule a time and place. Just make sure that you're not
  discussing sensitive issues where students might overhear. Try to meet
  at least twice a week.
</UL>
 
<H2>Observing the other instructors</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Spend an hour or two in each classroom during the first half of the
  session. This isn't a real formal thing, but check with the instructor
  & TA beforehand to see what's a good time. They may have special
  activities planned. This is a good time to peep at their
  record-keeping, and to acquire info for staff evaluations. Pay
  attention to the interactions of staff with students, and of staff
  with staff (i.e., is the instructor using the TA appropriately?).

<LI> Afterwards, tell them what you thought, and offer any suggestions or
  praise that apply.  If there were any serious problems, check up later
  to be sure that improvements have been made.
</UL>
 
<H2>Partner trouble</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Unfortunately, not every instructor-TA pair gets along
  perfectly. The staff members need to know that it's okay to
  disagree, as long as the discussions are held out of earshot of the
  students. Also, make sure they're aware that they should bring any
  serious problems to the attention of the coordinator or the academic
  dean quickly, so that they don't drag on unnecessarily.
</UL>
 
<H2>RA visits to classes</H2>

<UL>
<LI> For self-paced courses, these visits will be quick. Policy says that
  each RA is to attend classes 2 hrs/wk, but in self-paced classrooms
  there's little to see or do, and the RA's presence may in fact be a
  distraction. Also, pre-calc RAs frequently have students in several
  classes, and they must split their visitation time accordingly.
</UL>
 
<H2>Student evaluations</H2>

<UL>
<LI> It's Never Too Early to Start Writing Your Evals. Check with an
  administrator to make sure you know the little quirks of this year's
  evaluation format -- it changes every year, sometimes between
  sessions. Encourage new instructors to go to the how-to session that
  someone (probably the academic dean) will offer. Distribute sample
  math evals.  Get your own done early so you can worry about other
  things.
</UL>
 
<H2>Phone calls to families</H2>

<UL>
<LI> In the middle of the second week, ask all the instructors to review
  their students' progress and identify those kids who are unlikely to
  reach whatever goal they've set -- e.g., they've signed up for Algebra
  II in the fall and aren't going to finish Algebra I.  Each instructor
  should call the families of these students and explain the situation,
  being very careful to emphasize that the purpose of the call is to
  allow the family to start making plans for the fall ASAP, not a
  disciplinary action or an indicator of failure.

<LI> Anyone who calls a student's family must keep a record of what was
  said during the conversation. This is helpful not only if problems
  come up later, but also in making your evaluations and
  parent-conference conversations more specific.
</UL>
 
<H2>Extra Problems sessions</H2>

<UL>
<LI> There are a large number of interesting math problems (and computer
  science, and physics, and chemistry, and ...) which the students will
  enjoy tackling in their spare time and discussing in class. To many
  students, this is the best part of the day, so it's well worth a
  little of the instructors' time to prepare activities. The workload
  can be kept to a minimum if the staff take turns writing problems. CTY
  has a collection of suggested problems, but everyone on the math staff
  is strongly encouraged to bring their own as well.

<LI> Usually, the problems are handed out one day and discussed the
  next. The logistics of the discussion group vary from site to site,
  but the most common set-ups (with pros & cons) are: During the
  second hour of study hall -- this will require instructor's
  permission, otherwise kids will go to Extra Problems just to get out
  of study hall. However, it avoids most of the problems of the other
  two plans.  During an afternoon activity period -- doesn't interfere
  with class time, but not many kids are going to give up Ultimate to
  do more math. Even if they're really interested in the problem. On
  the other hand, kids from other classes might show up.  At the end
  of the afternoon class -- it's tricky to do this in a way that
  allows kids from different math classrooms to interact. More often,
  this is done in each classroom separately. Unfortunately, class
  discussions disrupt those kids who would rather keep working.
</UL>
 
<H2>Tailoring the CTY curriculum</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Many students in the upper pre-calc classes (those using the Brown
  Advanced Math book) are trying to place out of a class back home
  that involves pieces of several CTY courses. If you're lucky,
  they've brought curricula and/or textbooks from back home so that
  you'll know what their schools expect. More likely, you'll have to
  ask them to call home and have information sent (or you may have to
  make the calls yourself). The best way to handle the
  curriculum-matching problem is to have the student complete one CTY
  course (so that he/she will have certified in something), followed
  by piece-wise study to complete the home-school curriculum.
</UL>
 
<H2>HSST's, scantrons, scoring keys, and testing procedure</H2>

<UL>
<LI> The tests etc. should be at hand in the coordinator's classroom or
  some other convenient place. Make sure the instructors and TAs know
  how and where to administer the tests, and how to score them -- red
  or green Flair pens only! Also, see that the tests and keys are
  returned promptly so that they can remain secure.

<LI> The instructions included with the tests pretty much explain what to
  do. The two most important things for everyone to remember are: keep
  an eye on the clock, and have someone else double-check your scoring.
</UL>

<HR>
<H1>End of session</H1>

<H2>Student program evaluations (SPE's)</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Allow time for these to be filled out on the last or next-to-last
  day. The last study hall might be a good time. Make sure that the
  students know this is coming, so that they're not counting on this
  class time in order to study for or take a final exam.
</UL>
 
<H2>Student evaluations</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Hassle the other instructors as necessary to get their student evals
  finished on time. Yes, it's possible to drag out first session evals
  into second session, but this is a bad idea since there's so much
  stuff going on for session II. Encourage TA involvement in writing
  the evals. This doesn't just mean asking the TAs to type up the
  instructors' scribbled notes, although it's okay to ask for this
  type of help too. Often the TA gets to know some of the students
  better than the instructor does, and can give the instructor
  descriptions of these students' strengths, weaknesses, study habits,
  etc. This information makes an evaluation more personalized and
  informative.

<LI> You may be expected to pre-read the other instructors' evals before
  they go to an administrator. Don't worry about making them perfect,
  since your style is almost guaranteed to be slightly different from
  that of the official reader -- but you can filter out the obvious
  grammatical, punctuation, and content errors.
</UL>
 
<H2>Staff evaluations</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Write one for your TA. This will be kept on file for him/her in case
  of later job-reference requests. You may also be expected to write
  evals of the other instructors and of the other TAs, or of your math
  staff in general. There may be examples available.  The time limits
  on writing these are a bit looser, but try to have them done before
  you leave the site.
</UL>
 
<H2>Progress records, checklists, certification forms</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Make sure everyone fills out the checklists and cert forms according
  to whatever directions Baltimore has sent out this year. Don't
  assume it's the same as last year. It rarely is.
</UL>
 
<H2>Parent conferences</H2>

<UL>
<LI> TAs are not required to attend, but encourage them to do so. It's
  good practice if they're thinking of being an instructor. Most of
  them want to go to the conferences anyhow, so this isn't really an
  issue.

<LI> Parents will ask you what courses their children should take next,
  in regular school or at CTY. Try to have suggestions in
  mind. However, recognize that some parents will take what you say as
  gospel instead of discussing it with anyone else. Emphasize the
  necessity of talking to their home schools, and of considering the
  student's interests.

<LI> Most likely, the other instructors can handle all their parents'
  questions, but let them know that they can send tough ones your
  way. The same rules apply here as at the beginning of the session:
  answer what you can, don't make unnecessary promises or apologies,
  and don't feel compelled to deal with the really far-out cases (send
  them to an administrator and move along to the next family).
</UL>
 
<HR>
<H1>Between sessions</H1>

<H2>Departing staff</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Make sure that staff members who are leaving or switching jobs after
  first session get all their paperwork done and approved before they
  go. Find out where they have left classroom keys and teaching
  materials. Also, see that they've left an address which is valid for
  the remainder of the summer.
</UL>
 
<H2>Incoming staff members</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Try to be on hand to greet math staff members arriving between
  sessions. If you know during first session that people already on site
  will be joining the math staff during second session, try to meet them
  and introduce them to other math staffers before Intersession. They
  may want to borrow books to brush up on their math during first
  session; if you have books to spare, fire away. It may also be
  possible to get in touch with session II staff members who are not
  already on site, especially if they're at another CTY site for session
  I. This is rarely necessary, but in some cases (e.g., someone won't be
  arriving until just before placement testing) it becomes reasonable.
</UL>
 
<HR>
<H1>End of summer</H1>

<H2>Packing up</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Make sure all the textbooks, curriculum spirals, Regents books,
  etc. make their way back to Baltimore (or wherever they're going to
  spend the winter). Baltimore needs an inventory of what's staying on
  site, if anything.
</UL>
 
<H2>Evals, checklists, cert forms, diskettes, ...</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Don't leave until everyone has handed in all their paperwork. 
</UL>
