<H1>CTY Instructor's "Lab Manual"</H1>
<H2>For Applications of Contemporary Mathematics (ACOM)</H2>

Because the ACOM course was entirely new, instructors and TAs this
summer did not know in advance that it would be necessary to
supplement the textbook with a great deal of outside material on a
variety of topics: some related to the textbook, some entirely
unrelated, with varying difficulty levels to accomodate students' math
backgrounds.  Once these requirements became clear, the instructors
had to do a great deal of on-the-fly course planning, an exhausting
undertaking.  So that next summer's ACOM staff will not have to
develop so much course material during the summer session, several of
this year's staff are collecting and organizing the material they
developed.  This will be compiled into a "lab manual" from which
future ACOM instructors will be able to select a wide range of
already-prepared lessons.
