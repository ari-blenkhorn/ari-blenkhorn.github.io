	CRA Distributed Mentor Project Application Information
	======================================================

Introduction
------------
	The Computing Research Association's Distributed Mentor
Project brings together for a summer of research undergraduate females
in computer science and computer engineering (CS&E) and female
professors at research institutions.  The intent of the mentor
program, which is funded by the National Science foundation, is to
increase the number of women entering graduate school in CS&E. Because
of the limited number of female researchers in CS&E who can serve as
role models and mentors, undergraduates are brought directly to the
professors' institutions. Alternatively, a student and mentor from the
same institution may apply together.  Students will be involved in
research, learn how a research university operates, meet graduate
students and professors and get a chance to observe a successful
female researcher up close. It is an invaluable experience for any
female student who is considering applying to graduate school. The
program helps the student decide which graduate schools might be right
for her and boosts her chance of acceptance at those schools.

	Here is what previous student participants said about their 
experience:

   "I'm being pulled right into their research project! Right at the heart of
    it, and I wasn't expecting that. It's been a confidence booster for me."

   "Choosing the right graduate school is important, but now I know better 
    how to do that. And I know that I can go to grad school and make it 
    through and enjoy the time, and get something very important out of it."

   "She [my mentor] is like this shining model of success. Not a success in
    terms of business school success, but success in terms of how one would
    want to live one's lives."

Basic Structure
---------------
	A committee will examine the applications and select at least
20 student/professor matches for funding. Notification of matches will
be given by March 15, 1997.  funding for the student consists of $450
per week of research, plus travel assistance. A student's funding is
intended to cover 10 weeks of research in the summer of 1997, but
alternative arrangements are possible.  Mentors and their universities
receive no funding. However, students and mentors who participate in
the program may apply for limited funding to assist them in attending
a conference after the summer of research.  

	Mentors and students will be given training packages on
mentoring and will participate in an electronic discussion group. This
will provide additional mentoring opportunities while distributing the
load among mentors. It will establish cohesiveness among all
participants and is intended to be a source of support for mentors and
students.  One aspect of the continuing project is a longitudinal
evaluation, covering all five years of the project (1994-98). This
third-party evaluation is intended to provide formative feedback and
to assess the long-term impact of the project.  The evaluation is not
intended to check on the performance of individuals participating in
the project, and participants' anonymity will be maintained as far as
is possible. All participants are expected to take part in the
evaluation; the time involved will be minimal.  A preliminary
evaluation report for the first three years of the project is
available on the Web at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~condon/mentor.html, by
anonymous FTP at ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu:/cra-mentor and from the AFS
file system at /afs/cs.wisc.edu/p/ftp/cra-mentor.

Students: Criteria for Selection
--------------------------------
	Applicants should be female undergraduates (US citizens or
permanent residents) at a US college or university who are seriously
considering graduate studies in CS&E. First consideration will be
given to sophomores and juniors (completing two or three years by the
summer of 1997). However, first-year students with the skills needed
for research and seniors considering graduate school later than
September 1997 also may apply.  The primary criteria for selection
are: 1. The student's experience and skills must match the needs of
some professor's research project.  2. The student's record and
recommendations should indicate the potential for success in graduate
school.  3. Preference will be given to students who stand to gain the
most from the experience (for example, students at institutions unable
to offer research opportunities with female professors).

Student Applications
--------------------

1. Basic Information
       Name
       Social Security number (for tax purposes)
       Indicate if you are a US citizen or permanent resident, or will be by
             summer 1997 (required by NSF)
       School in which currently enrolled
       Academic year address and telephone
       Permanent home address and telephone
       E-mail address
       Number of years completed by May 1997
       Major

2. Transcript
	Send an official transcript, including courses taken through
December 1996, grades and a list of courses to be taken spring
1997. An unofficial copy may be sent first if the official copy cannot
be sent before the application deadline.

3. Letters of Recommendation
	These letters are important for predicting likely success in
graduate school. However, some students may not have connected enough
with a professor to obtain a substantive letter of
recommendation. Therefore, letters are optional, but we encourage
students to have two letters submitted. Recommenders should contact
Anne Condon directly. Electronic submissions are acceptable. E-mail:
cra-student@cs.wisc.edu.

4. Technical Statement
	Submit a statement of about 500 words detailing your interests
in CS&E and the specific skills you have attained (programming
language proficiency, operating systems familiarity, hardware design
experience and other skills not evident from your transcript).

5. Mentoring Statement
	Rank the following topics according to your interest in them: career
opportunities in academia or industry, balancing work and family life,
improving self-confidence, dealing with a chilly working environment,
establishing professional contacts and learning about the research
process.  You may, but are not required to, indicate minority status,
disability, sexual orientation or other factors you would like
considered.  List any mentoring-related resources you have used in the
past (such as mentoring programs, electronic resources,
extracurricular technical groups).

6. Restrictions
	Indicate geographic restrictions or time constraints that
would affect a match. In previous years, a number of worthy applicants
could not be funded because of overly precise geographical
preferences. Is there a particular professor with whom you would like
to work?

	All application materials are due on or before Feb. 1, 1997. 
Electronic submission to cra-student@cs.wisc.edu is encouraged. Send 
transcripts and other nonelectronic information to:

		Anne Condon
		Department of Computer Science and Engineering
		University of Washington, Box 352350
		Seattle, WA 98195-2350
		Tel. 206-543-4229; fax: 206-543-2969

Professors: Criteria for Selection
----------------------------------

	Potential mentors should be female CS&E professors at US
universities with active research programs into which the students may
be integrated.  The primary criteria for selection are:
	1. The professor should have a research project suitable for
undergraduates. The project should match the skills of some student
applicants.
	2. The professor's university environment should be one
conducive to the goals of the mentoring project. For example, an
active graduate summer research population provides the protege with a
window on future graduate life.
	3. The professor should have demonstrated some skill in the
delicate task of mentoring undergraduates.  Professors who already
have funds to support undergraduates (e.g., through an REU supplement
to an NSF grant) may still apply to be matched with a student. In such
cases, CRA funding will be applied toward those students' travel
expenses.
	
	Mentors may request more than one student, especially if a
single student would be isolated. However, we expect to limit awards
to two students per mentor. Two or more mentors may submit a single
application to jointly supervise one or more students.

Mentor Applications
-------------------

1. Basic Information
	Name
	US postal address, telephone and fax
	E-mail address
	Names and addresses of your department chair, dean or anyone else who
	     should be notified of your award and contributions 
	     if you are selected.

2. Curriculum Vitae
	Acceptable in any form. The short form used for NSF grants is the most
convenient.

3. Research Proposal(s)
	Submit a one-page description of each undergraduate project. A
copy of material prepared for another grant proposal is
acceptable. The target is the selection committee, not the students.

4. Special Requirements
	Indicate the basic skills required of the students, either in
courses taken-calculus, linear algebra, data structures, computer
graphics, logic design and so on-or other proficiencies (for example,
knows C and Unix).  This information is crucial for arranging
appropriate matches. Highly specific and advanced skills requirements
reduce the likelihood of a match.  Are there particular students you
wish to work with?

5. Mentoring Skills
	Include information on your mentoring skills and
experience. To help us in matching you with a student, indicate
specific topics on which you can provide good advice (see Item #5 in
the student application for ideas). Are you willing to participate in
an electronic discussion group involving other mentors and students?

6. Working Environment and Lodging
	If possible, describe the expected working environment for the
student.  Useful information includes opportunities for technical and
social interaction with graduate students, and institutional
commitment (office and computer facilities, and access to
institutional recreational facilities). Can students obtain low-cost
lodging-for example, at the university dormitories?

	All application materials are due on or before Feb. 1,
1997. Electronic submission to cra-mentor@cs.wisc.edu is
encouraged. Nonelectronic information should be sent to:

		Anne Condon
		Department of Computer Science and Engineering
		University of Washington, Box 352350
		Seattle, WA 98195-2350
		Tel. 206-543-4229; fax: 206-543-2969
