      <h1>Static Objects in Dynamically Loaded C++ Modules</h1>

When you're dynamically loading a C++ .so into a main program which
was written in C, the constructor functions for static objects are
never called.  Why do we care?  For me, the reason to care is that I
want to write extension modules in C++ for the <A
HREF="http://www.python.org">Python</A> language.  The Python
interpreter is written in C, and recompiling it with C++ is a real
pain (if you can get it to compile that way at all!), so I need to
get dynamic loading of my C++ modules to work correctly with the 
unmodified interpreter.

<p>
<H3>What's Going Wrong</H3>
When you compile a C++ file to a .o, the C++ compiler creates special
functions to call the constructors of any static objects.  Since the
Python interpreter is written & compiled in C, and therefore doesn't
know about constructors, it never calls these magic functions when a
C++ module is dynamically loaded.  So, we need to make sure that these
functions get called.

<p>
<H3>How to Fix It</H3> 

Basically, you compile all your files to .o's, inspect the .o files
(and any libraries you're using) to find the magic functions, then
construct a function that calls all the magic ones.  I've written a
little <A HREF="static_construct.py">Python
script</A> to do this.  It's really pretty braindead; you give it a
list of .o's and libraries, it writes (to stdout) a file that contains
one function, called static_construct.  Redirect this to a file, and
compile it.  Put static_construct's prototype in your module, and
write your module so that it calls static_construct() right away.  (In
Python modules, that means the first thing initxxxmodule does is call
static_construct().)  You only have to make these changes to your
module once, not every time you compile.  Link everything together
into the module.  And now, when the Python interpreter loads your
module, the constructors get called.  Much fun.

<p>

On an Irix machine, the magic functions all start with __sti__.
(There are also destructor-calling functions for these objects,
starting with __std__, but probably you don't really care about
destructing at the end of the program.  If you do you can figure it
out from the way I'm doing constructors.)

<p>

So now the relevant part of my makefile looks like this:
<p>
<pre>
mymodule.so:	$(MYOBJ)
	static_construct $(MYOBJ) /usr/lib/libC.so $(CORIOLISDIR)/lib/sgi_53/libcsupport.a > sc.c
	CC $(WARNINGS) -c $(CFLAGS) $(IFLAGS) sc.c -o sc.o
	ld -shared sc.o $(MYOBJ)  -o mymodule.so -L$(CORIOLISDIR)/lib/sgi_53 -lcsupport
</pre>

Many, many thanks to David Baraff for figuring out how to do this.
