<H1>Silly Delaware DMV!</H1>

The state of Delaware, like most states, issues numerical license
plates unless you pay an extra fee to get a personalized plate, aka a
"vanity tag".  However, if a Delaware driver wants a vanity tag, she
must get this <EM>in addition</EM> to the numerical plate, since the
DMV's software apparently can't handle records indexed by personalized
tags.  The only reason I can see for this is that the standard plates
are <EM>numerical</EM>, meaning 0 through 9 only, with no letters or
other symbols in them, and the folks who wrote the software way back
when made the assumption that that would always be true for all
license plates, and wrote software that can't handle any other
characters.  <P>

That can't be the answer, though.  There has got to be a way that they
can look up a record by the vanity tag alone.  Otherwise the
authorities would not be able to identify a car that had a vanity tag
unless the owner was present and gave the necessary info to them.
Kinda useless in the case of a hit-and-run incident. <P>

But whatever the reason for the double-tagging, here's the really
bizarre thing.  You have to carry the numerical plate in your trunk,
and if you're ever pulled over, you have to get that plate out and
show it to the police so that they can look you up under that tag.
Now, say you're in a distant state for the summer (oh, let's say
California...)  and you get pulled over.  <EM>What cops in their right
minds are going to believe that they should ignore the plate on your
car and look up the other one that you've got stashed in the
trunk??</EM> You're going to be lucky if cops 3000 miles away have
even <EM>heard of</EM> Delaware, let alone having any idea of how
Delaware's DMV does things.  <P>

Suffice it to say that I drove with unusual care and restraint last
summer.
