In February 1998 I joined Industrial Light & Magic as a Production
Software Engineer, aka "Software Wrangler".  Basically, my job was to keep 
problems in the graphics software
from preventing the artists from getting their shots done.  When
software broke... or never worked... or someone wanted a new feature
added... or just wanted to know what the heck the computer was doing
<I>"because I've got to have this shot finished TODAY!"</I>... they 
called me.
<p>
In Spring of 2000, I started working with the simulation group in the
software R&D department.  The first several months were spent on the
fluid simulation engines -- improving, developing the UI, multithreading,
etc.  More recently I've been doing much the same thing for the cloth
simulation system, for shows including Star Wars Episode II and Harry 
Potter II.

George Lucas, in a New York Times

interview</a>, 21 March 1999:
<br>
<i>
   What comes out is kind of amazing to all of us, not just to those
   people who see it in the end. We, too, are amazed when we do it!
   Which is where the fun of it, the joy of what we do, comes from.
   It's the joy of creativity. We put it together, step back, look at
   it and say, "Whoa, that's kind of neat!" As corny as that sounds,
   that's ultimately the primary driving force for us.
