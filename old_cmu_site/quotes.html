      <H1>Quotes and Poetry links</H1>

A random jumble of quotes from famous sources, professors, friends,
things I've written, etc., plus links (or at least names & authors)
for my favorite poems.  I store this here so that I can devote my
limited brain space to Babylon 5 trivia.  I've left the names off the
more embarrassing quotes, so that my friends will still speak to me
after they read this...

Do what you love, love what you do.

      <I>Allen Newell</I>

TCP is more exciting than UDP, and the way you know that
is by the size of the header.

      <I>A CMU computer science professor</I>
<HR>
Those three little words that mean so much:  "Shut up, dear."
<HR>
It's a cult of personality, and I'm his high priestess.
<HR>
There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to find out.

      <I>Cat Stevens</I>
<HR>
We, the unwilling, led by the unknowing, are doing the impossible
for the ungrateful.  We have done so much, for so long, with so
little, that now we are capable of doing practically anything with
nearly nothing.

      <I>Johns Hopkins University Barnstormers tech crew motto</I>
      <I>(original source unknown)</I>

The lottery is a tax on people who are bad at math.
<HR>
If your "solution" to the two-body problem is a long-distance relationship:
Brains, Trains, and Automobiles.
<HR>
Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne conna&icirc;t pont.
(the heart has its reasons, whereof reason knows nothing)
(alternately: the heart has reasons that Reason does not know)

      <I>Blaise Pascal</I>
<HR>
Scratch most feminists and underneath there is a woman
who longs to be a sex object. The difference is that is
not all she longs to be. 

      <I>Betty Rollin</I> 
<HR>
I must admit that I find television very educational.
The minute somebody turns it on, I go to the library
and read a book. 

      <I>Groucho Marx</I> 
<HR>
Razors pain you;
Rivers are damp;
Acids stain you;
And drugs cause cramp.

Guns aren't lawful;
Nooses give;
Gas smells awful;
You might as well live.

      <I>Dorothy Parker</I> 
<HR>
Men seldom make passes
At girls who wear glasses.

      <I>Dorothy Parker</I> 
<HR>
Lovemaking is the consolation for living in the body
just as art is the consolation for living in the world.

      <I>Helmut -- The God In Flight</I> 
<HR>
The five food groups of graduate school:
sugar, salt, grease, caffeine, and alcohol
<HR>
To those who would call it sci-fi
I must point out with a sigh
  Please study your diction
  For in science fiction
The second word has no long I.

Gentle reader, you may wonder why
SF's not the same as sci-fi
  Well, there's a fine line
  Between Robert Heinlein
And "Revenge of the Two-Headed Fly."

      <I>unknown</I> 
<HR>
.....because the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are
mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at
the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but
burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like
spiders across the stars.....

      <I>Jack Kerouac -- "On the Road"</I>
<HR>
Life is a ride -- we're all strapped in and none of us can stop it.

The best you can hope for at the end of life is that your hair's
messed up, you're out of breath, and you didn't throw up.

      <I>Jerry Seinfeld</I>
<HR>
In our society we have hard nerds and soft nerds.   The hard nerds are
the ones who used to have the slide rules at their belt; now they have
calculators.  The soft nerds are the ones who get violently ill whenever
anybody mentions an integral sign.

      <I>Alan Kay</I>
<HR>
The good Christian should beware of mathematicians and all those who
make empty prophecies.  The danger already exists that mathematicians
have made a covenant with the devil to darken the spirit and confine
man in the bonds of Hell.

      <I>St. Augustine</I>
<HR>
But be sure that I'll be there
To help you make it through
'Cause I'd sure love to be there
Looking back with you

No straight lines make up my life, all my roads have bends.
There's no clear-cut beginning, and so far, no dead ends.

      <I>Harry Chapin</I>
<HR>
Take your time, think a lot
Think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

      <I>Cat Stevens, "Father and Son"</I>
<HR>
Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art ... It has no survival
value: rather it is one of those things that give value to survival.

      <I>C.S. Lewis</I>
<HR>
Everybody is ignorant, only on different subjects.

      <I>Will Rogers</I>
<HR>
Didn't I know
How it would go?
If I knew from the start,
Why am I falling apart?
