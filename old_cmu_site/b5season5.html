                Voice over by Peter David:

        "It was the dawn of the fifth season of Babylon 5,  ten years
after the earthman's vision. The Straczynski project was a dream given
form.  Its goal: to prevent people from having actual lives, by
creating a show so moving that they forget about everything else. It
became a reality away from reality for actors, writers, fans and
executive producers. It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last
best hope for good television. The year is 1997. The name of the place,
is office number 5."
        Credits now run to music.  After the credits run, we have a
POV shot of a teddy bear following another along the desk, jumping over
the puddle of drool and around the head, finally exiting into the ear.
When everything goes dark, flash the line, "created by some poor guy
lying collapsed on his desk known only as Joe."
