1)  Edinburgh Parallel Computer Centre

The Edinburgh Parallel Computer Centre (EPCC) Summer Scholarship Programme
(SSP) has been running for a number of years now, providing training and
project work in various areas of High Performance Computing. In 1997 12
places will be offered to senior undergraduates; there are no restrictions
on nationality, or degree subject although applicants need to demonstrate
a reasonable level of programming skills. The 1997 SSP will run for 10
weeks beginning on Monday 7th July 1997, with applications for places
closing on 31st January 1997. 

EPCC is part of the University of Edinburgh, and is the site of the UK
National Supercomputer, a 512 processor Cray T3D, one of the largest
facilities in Europe. Students working on the SSP will have access to the
T3D and other EPCC hardware during their stay. 

More information on this and previous years SSP's is available from our
Web site

        (http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/ssp/)

or directly from me

2) Supercomputing Program for Undergraduate Research

From: Jeanne C. Butler <jeanne@tc.cornell.edu>

Subject: Supercomputing Program for Undergraduate Research

Cornell Theory Center

1997 Supercomputing Program for Undergraduate Research (SPUR)

JUNE 1 - AUGUST 1, 1997

This program offers undergraduate students the opportunity to pursue a
computational science research project while developing skills in the use
of high-performance computing technologies. Students apply to work on a
specific research project under the guidance of a faculty or staff member
at Cornell University. The proposed projects below explore current
research problems in a diversity of areas, such as chemistry, solar
convection, pollution control, fractals, and population modeling. Several
of the projects include a strong visualization component. 

Successful applicants will attend, full time, a nine-week training and
research program at Cornell University and will pursue the research
projects using the high-performance computing resources of the Cornell
Theory Center. Students will receive a stipend of $2,000, travel
allowance, room (shared dorm room), and partial board (allowance at campus
dining facilities). 

Applicants must be undergraduate students (graduating not before December,
1997) who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Students must have
relevant coursework for their research areas, as well as coursework or
programming experience in Fortran or C. Students who participated in
previous SPURs are not eligible. 

Women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are strongly encouraged
to apply. Students from four-year colleges with limited research
facilities are also encouraged to apply. 

Applicants must submit a completed application form, two letters of
recommendation, and college transcript(s). Applications must be received
by February 28, 1997. Students will be notified of their acceptance no
later than March 15.

It is anticipated that this program will be sponsored by the National
Science Foundation; the program is dependent upon approval of funding
through the Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program.
