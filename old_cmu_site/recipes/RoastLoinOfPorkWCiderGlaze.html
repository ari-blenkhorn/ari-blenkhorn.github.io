Place pork in small roasting pan.  In small bowl, combine remaining
ingredients, except wine and water.  Rub mixture over pork, cover, and
marinate for 30 minutes.  Pour off and reserve cider mixture.  Add wine to
pan and place in 500 degree oven.  Roast 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350
and roast about 30 minutes, basting occasionally with cider mixture, until
thermometer registers 145-150 degrees.  Remove from oven; transfer to
carving board and let rest 10 minutes.  Place pan over medium heat.  Add
water and scrape up caramelized bits, stirring until reduced slightly.
Slice pork (it should be pink in the center), drizzle with sauce, and
serve immediately.
