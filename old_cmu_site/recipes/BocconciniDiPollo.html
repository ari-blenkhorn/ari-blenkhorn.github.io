<menu>
2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast<br>
2 tsp salt<br>
1/4 tsp ground white pepper<br>
2 tsp fresh or 1 tsp dried rosemary leaves<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
1 cup olive oil<br>
1/4 cup clear chicken broth<br>
juice of one lemon<p>
</menu>

Wash chicken breast and pat dry.  Remove and discard all fatty parts
and tendons.  Cut into 3/4 inch cubes.  Place in a small saucepan with
salt, pepper, rosemary leaves, and garlic.  Toss to distribute the
seasoning evenly.  Add all the oil and set aside in the refrigerator
for several hours or overnight. <P>

Place on moderately high heat and brown for 10 minutes, stirring
frequently.  Add the broth and let the steam bring the flavors
together for 1 minute.  Add lemon juice and remove from heat.  Serve
with its gravy and <A HREF="SpinaciAllAgro.html">spinaci all'agro</A>.
