Melt butter in saute pan over medium heat.  Stir in apples, lemon
juice, sugar, and flour.  Cover partially and cook until tender, 15-20
min.  Stir in vanilla.  Transfer to buttered 10" pie dish.  Combine
flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  Cut in butter with a pastry
blender or your fingertips until mixture resembles crumbs.  Stir in
ginger.  Stir orange zest into cream; then, using a fork, stir cream
into flour until it holds together.  Gather dough into a ball.  Knead
briefly then roll out to a little larger than pie dish.  Transfer to
dish.  Trim off excess.  Cut a hold in center.  Brush with cream.
Bake 10 min in 450 degree oven.  Reduce heat to 375 and bake 20-25
min.  Serve warm, with whipped cream.
