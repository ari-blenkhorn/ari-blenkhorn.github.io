In a large saucepan, saute shallots and scallions in olive oil until
translucent, about 2 min.  Add basil, olives, tuna, lemon zest, and
lemon juice.  Season to taste with salt and pepper and stir until well
heated.  Set aside and cover to keep warm.  Meanwhile, bring a large
pot of water to a rolling boil over high heat.  Add pasta and 1 Tbsp
salt and boil until al dente.  Drain pasta and add to tuna-olive
mixture.  Toss well and briefly reheat before serving.
