    16 oz semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate, cut into bits<br>
    5 oz sweet butter<br>
    5 large eggs, separated<br>
    1 Tbsp flour<br>
    1/4 tsp cream of tartar<br>
    3-4 Tbsp sugar<br>
    4 cups heavy cream<br>
    One or a pair of the following sauces:<br>

 Preheat oven to 425.  Line 8x2-inch round cake pan with parchment
or waxed paper.<p>

 Melt the chocolate and butter in a small bowl placed in a barely
simmering water bath over low heat, stirring occasionally until
smooth.  Or, microwave on medium (50%) for about 3 minutes and 50
seconds.  Stir until completely melted and smooth.  Whisk in egg yolks
and flour.  Set aside.<p>

 Beat egg whites with cream of tartar in a clean, dry mixing bowl
at medium speed until soft peaks form.  Gradually sprinkle in 1 Tbsp
sugar, beating at high speed, until stiff but not dry.  Fold about
one-quarter of egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it.
Quickly fold in remaining whites.  Turn mixture into prepared pan.
Bake for exactly 15 minutes.<p>

 Remove from oven and cool in pan.  Cake will rise somewhat,
especially around edges, but will still seem undercooked.  At it
cools, it will sink in the center.  This is correct!  Let the dessert
cool completely in the pan on a rack.  Cover and chill for several
hours in the refrigerator.<p>

 Run a knife or small spatula around the edge to release it from
pan.  Warm the bottom of the pan on a stove burner for just a few
seconds; invert it onto a plate to unmold.  Peel the parchment liner
from bottom and invert again onto serving plate or corrugated cake
circle (if you plan to frost it with whipped cream).  The cake circle
will be 1/2 inch bigger than the dessert all around.  The dessert will
be right-side-up and higher around the edges than in the middle.  It
may be made to this point up to 4 days in advance.  Wrap well and
refrigerate until needed, or freeze for up to 3 months.<p>

 To serve simply: Remove from refrigerator at least 1 hour in
advance.  Cut in wedges and pass lightly sweetened whipped cream and
sauces separately.<p>

To serve more formally: Whip cream with remaining 3 Tbsp of sugar
and mask cake thickly with about 3/4 of it.  Scrape the remaining
whipped cream into pastry bag and pipe large rosettes or swirls around
the top edge of the cake.
