<LI>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  To prepare crumb
crust/topping, spread nuts in a medium baking pan.  Roast the nuts,
stirring occasionally, until toasted, about 10 minutes.

<LI>Remove nuts from the oven and turn out onto a cloth towel.  Rub
off and discard the papery skins.  Increase the oven temperature to
450 degrees F.

<LI>In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, process the nuts
until finely ground, about 10 seconds.

<LI>In a large bowl, mix together the nuts, flour, and sugar.  Using a
pastry blender or 2 knives, cut the butter into the flour mixture
until coarse crumbs form.

<LI>Using fingers, evenly press half the crumb crust/topping mixture
into the bottom and sides of an 8- or 9-inch tart pan.

<LI>To prepare the filling: in a medium bowl, mix together the sugar
and the cornstarch.  Gently fold in the berries.  Spoon the berry
mixture into the crust, spreading evenly.

<LI>Sprinkle the berry mixture evenly wiith the remaining crumb
crust/topping.

<LI>Bake until topping is golden and filling is bubbly, 30 minutes.
Transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes.  Serve warm.

<LI>
Baking Tips: Watch nuts very carefully when you are grinding them in
the food processor.  If you grind them too long, the result will be
nut butter.
