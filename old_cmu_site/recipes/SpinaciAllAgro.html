<i>Spinach cooks down a great deal, but you'll need a BIG pot to hold
it at first.  One of those blue-speckled enamel pots that we used for
crab-boiling when I lived in Baltimore would do fine.  Or cook the
spinach in batches and recombine in the serving bowl.</i><p>


<menu>
3 pounds small-leaved bulk spinach<br>
1/2 tsp salt<br>
4 Tbsp olive oil<br>
juice of one lemon<p>
</menu>

Remove stems and roots from spinach.  Rinse in cold water many times
until any trace of sand is removed.  Place in a large pot with 1/4 tsp
salt and no water other than that which clings to the spinach from
washing.  Cook over moderately high heat, covered, until desired
tenderness.  Transfer to a colander to cool, lifting the spinach out
of the pot rather than pouring it, so that any sand remains in the
pot. <P>

Turn onto a cutting board and chop very fine.  Do not use a food
processor. <P>

Place in a serving dish and flatten with a spatula.  Sprinkle with the
remaining salt and the oil.  Just before serving, sprinkle with lemon
juice.
