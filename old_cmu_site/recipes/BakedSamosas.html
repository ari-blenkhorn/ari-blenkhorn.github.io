<i>Unlike most samosas, these are baked instead of fried.  Or maybe "oven-fried"
is a better description, since the pan is heavily oiled.</i><br>

DOUGH<br>

<menu>
2 1/2 c flour<br>
1/2 tsp salt<br>
1 c buttermilk or yogurt<br>
extra flour as needed<p>
</menu>

Place the flour in a medium-sized bowl. Mix in the salt.
Make a well in the center, and add the buttermilk or yogurt.
Mix first with a spoon and then with your hand, to make smooth dough.
Add extra flour, as needed to keep the dough from being sticky.
The dough will be quite soft.  Knead in the bowl for about 5 minutes.
Cover tightly and refrigerate until you are ready to assemble to
pastries. <p>

FILLING<br>

<menu>
large potatoes (the size of a large person's fist)<br>
1 Tbsp butter<br>
1 c. finely minced onion<br>
at least 2 medium cloves garlic, minced<br>
1 Tbsp freshly grated ginger<br>
1 tsp mustard seeds (black mustard seed is best)<br>
1 tsp dried coriander<br>
3/4 tsp salt<br>
1 1/2 c uncooked green peas (frozen thawed is fine)<br>
2 Tbsp lemon juice<br>
cayenne, to taste<p>
</menu>

Peel potatoes, chop into 1 in. pieces, boil until very soft, drain,
mash.  Melt butter and add onion, garlic, ginger, mustard seeds,
coriander and salt.  Saute over medium heat until onions are soft. Add
to mashed potatoes along with the rest of the ingredients.  Let
filling cool for 15 minutes before filling pastries.<P>

Preheat oven to 425oF. <i>Generously</i> oil a baking sheet.  Roll dough
into 1-inch balls and then use a rolling pin to roll those into 5-inch
circles.  Put 1 1/2 Tbsp filling on each circle, fold over like a
turnover.  Brush inside edges of circle with water and fold edges
together to make a hem.  Crimp edges with fork.  Put the samosas on
the baking sheet and brush with oil.  Bake 15 minutes at 425.<p>

DIPPING SAUCE<br>

<menu>
1/2 c. cider vinegar<br>
1/2 c. water<br>
3 tbsp. brown sugar<br>
1 small clove garlic, minced<br>
1tsp of salt<p>
</menu>

Place ingredients in saucepan and stir until sugar dissolves.
Heat to boiling, then simmer uncovered for 10 minutes.
