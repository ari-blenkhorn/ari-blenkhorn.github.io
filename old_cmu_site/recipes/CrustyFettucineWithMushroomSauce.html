The cookbook calls for homemade pasta, and gives the quantity in terms
of how many eggs & cups of flour go into the pasta.  I used store-bought
dried fettucine and it worked fine.  Use a little more than you'd expect
to need by measuring, and cook it al dente.

<menu>
    Homemade pasta made w/ 4 eggs and 2 1/2 to 3 cups flour<br>
    6 quarts water<br>
    3 Tbsp salt<br>
    3 cups <a href="MushroomSauce.html">mushroom sauce</a><br>
    Olive oil<p>
</menu>

Roll dough not too thin and cut into fettucine.  Bring 6 quarts of
water to a boil. Add pasta and salt; when boiling resumes, cook for 1
minute.  Drain well, place in a large bowl with the mushroom sauce,
and toss quickly to distribute the sauce evenly.  Loosely cover with a
clean towel and set aside for a few hours.<p>

Heat 3 Tbsp of oil in a large frying pan.  Pour half the dressed
fettucine in the pan and flatten down with a spatula.  Cook over very
low heat, shaking the pan from time to time, until a golden crust is
formed at the bottom.  Turn by covering with a dish and flipping, then
cook until golden on the other side.  Repeat with the other half of
fettucine.
