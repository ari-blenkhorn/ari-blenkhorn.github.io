<menu>
    1/2 cup raspberry vinegar<br>
    1/4 cup minced shallots<br>
    1/4 cup heavy cream<br>
    1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into 16 pieces<br>
    2 Tsp seedless raspberry jam<br>
    Fresh raspberries for garnish<p>
</menu>

In a small saucepan, combine raspberry vinegar and shallots.  Cook over
medium-high heat until vinegar is reduced to 2 tablespoons.  Add cream
and continue cooking until liquid is reduced to 2 tablespoons.  Remove
from heat; whisk in 2 or 3 pieces of butter, one piece at a time.  Place
over low heat and cook, whisking in remaining butter [one piece at a time]
until mixture is almost the consistency of mayonnaise.  Whisk in jam. (Be
careful not to over-cook, or you'll break the emulsion.)
