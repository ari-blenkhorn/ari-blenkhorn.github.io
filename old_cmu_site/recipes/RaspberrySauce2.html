<menu>
    Two 10-12 oz packages of frozen raspberries<br>
    2-3 Tbsp confectioner's sugar, optional<p>
</menu>


Thaw raspberries without heating them.  Drain and reserve the juice. <P>

 Puree the raspberries in a food processor or blender.  Pass the
puree through a strainer to remove the seeds.  Add some or all of the
reserved juice to the puree, depending on how thin you would like it
to be.  Taste and sweeten, if desired.  Refrigerate until needed.
Sauce may be prepared and refrigerated up to 3 days in advance, or
frozen for 6 months or longer.  Never heat the sauce, even to thaw it. <P>

 To serve, spoon onto plate next to dessert.
