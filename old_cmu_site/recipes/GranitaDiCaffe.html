<i>Serves 6</i><br>
<i>You can use decaf coffee if you prefer.
Flavored coffees such as hazelnut, cinnamon, Amaretto, or Mocha are
also nice.</i><br>
<i>Loosely based on a recipe from The Classic Cuisine of the Italian Jews II, by Edda Servi Machlin</i><br>
<i>Ari Rapkin</i><p>

<menu>
4 cups of freshly-brewed espresso or coffee (8-oz. measuring cups, not 5 or 6-oz. coffee cups)<br>
4 Tbsp sugar<p>
</menu>

Add the sugar to the coffee while still hot.  Mix well.  Pour into
two ice-cube trays and freeze for several hours or overnight.  While ice is
freezing, set 6 wine glasses or small bowls in the refrigerator to chill.
<P>

Just before dinner (so your guests don't see you frantically
scooping ice into glasses at dessert time :-), run the ice cubes
through a food processor one tray at a time.  Pack the ice crystals
into the wine glasses, and immediately set the glasses in the freezer.
Get as much of the first tray of ice out of the food processor as you
can, or the second batch of ice cubes won't be able to fall into the
path of the blades.  <P>


When ready to serve, top the glasses of ice with any of the following:
<ul>
<li> whipped cream (add vanilla, sugar, almond extract, etc.)
<li> liqueurs (Amaretto, Kahlua, Baileys, etc.)
<li> chocolate curls or small pieces
<li> <a href="CandiedCitrusZests.html">candied citrus peel</a>
</ul><p>
