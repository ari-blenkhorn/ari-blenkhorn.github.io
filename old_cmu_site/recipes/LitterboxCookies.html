<i>There are two flavors: chocolate and gingerbread.  The cookies are
dense and not very sweet.  This is necessary so that they will keep
their shape during baking.  If you use white flour or sugar they may
be tastier but they won't look like shit.</i><p>


<menu>
<b>Chocolate ingredients</b><br>
    1/2 cup honey<br>
    2/3 cup (1 and 1/3 stick) butter or margarine<br>
    1 egg<br>
    1 tsp vanilla or peppermint extract<br>
    2 cups whole wheat flour<br>
    1/3 cup cocoa powder<br>
    grape-nuts(tm) cereal<p>
<br>
<b>Gingerbread ingredients</b><br>
    1/4 cup honey<br>
    1/4 cup molasses<br>
    2/3 cup(1 and 1/3 stick) butter or margarine<br>
    1 egg<br>
    2 and 1/3 cups whole wheat flour<br>
    spices-ginger, cinnamon, cloves to taste(maybe 1/2 tsp each)<br>
    grape-nuts(tm) cereal<p>
<br>
<b>Mix-ins</b><br>
    coconut<br>
    chocolate chips<br>
    butterscotch chips<br>
    peanut butter chips<p>
</menu>

Microwave the honey till it bubbles (about 1 minute). Add the butter, and
the molasses, if any.  Add the egg, mix well, then mix in all the other 
stuff. Add mix-ins of your choice to some or all of the batter.<p>

Chill 1 hour in the freezer or several hours in the fridge.  Roll dough 
logs of random length and the diameter of cat poops.  Roll logs in grape-
nuts and bake at 350 degrees till done (10 to 15 minutes).<p>

Serve in a disposable cat litter box on a bed of grapenuts, with a cat
litter scoop.  You get lovely effects by decorating the box and 
scoop with melted chocolate, pudding, brownie mix, etc., and by tinting
the grapenuts pale green with colored powdered sugar.  Also try scattering
plastic flies around the table.
