<h1> Sweet Red Bean Paste Filling for Steamed Buns</h1>

<i>Ari Rapkin</i><p>

<i>Sweet red bean paste can be bought in the store, and used straight
from the can for filling, but this is how to make it from scratch.</i><p>

<menu>
    1 1/2 cups red beans, washed well<br>
    4 cups water<br>
    1/2 cup vegetable shortening<br>
    1 cup sugar<p>
</menu>

Place the beans and water in a saucepan, cover, bring to boil over
medium high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 1 1/2 hours,
or until beans are very soft. 

Strain the water from the beans, and blend them into a puree in a
blender or food processor. 

Press the puree through a sieve, discarding the skins, which will be
left in the sieve. 

Place the puree in several layers of cheesecloth, and gently squeeze
to remove excess moisture. 

Place the thickened puree back into the saucepan, together with the
sugar and vegetable shortening, and heat over low heat, stirring until
it becomes a thick paste. Stir and scrape vigorously so that it does
not stick to the bottom. 

Remove from heat and let cool before filling buns.
