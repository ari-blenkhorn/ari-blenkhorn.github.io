<menu>
<b>Crust</b><br>
1/2 cup gingersnap crumbs<br>
<br>
<b>Filling</b><br>
2 lbs cream cheese, softened<br>
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br>
1/3 cup all-purpose flour, sifted<br>
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon<br>
1 tsp grated nutmeg<br>
1 tsp ground cloves<br>
1/4 tsp allspice<br>
1/8 tsp salt<br>
6 eggs<br>
2 cups pumpkin puree<br>
<br>
<b>Topping</b><br>

1/2 cup chopped pecans<p>
</menu>

Sprinkle the gingersnap crumbs onto the bottom and sides of a
well-buttered 9-inch springform pan.  Chill until ready for
filling.<P>

In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar, flour, cinnamon,
nutmeg, cloves, allspice, salt, and eggs until smooth.  Add the
pumpkin puree and continue to beat until very smooth.  Pour the
mixture into the chilled springform pan and bake in a preheated
325-degree oven for 1 1/2 hours.  Turn off the oven and let the cake
stand in the open oven for 30 minutes.  Transfer to a wire rack and
let cool completely.<p>

Carefully remove the sides of the springform pan.  In a chilled bowl,
whip the heavy cream and spread it over the top of the cake.  Sprinkle
the chopped pecans on top of the whipped cream.  Transfer the cake to
a serving dish and serve.
