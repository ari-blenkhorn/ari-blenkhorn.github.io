<menu>
    1 3/4 cups hot water <br>
    3 Tbsp sugar <br>
    2 Tbsp vegetable shortening or oil <br>
    6 cups all-purpose (plain) flour <br>
    2 Tbsp baking powder <br>
    1/2 tsp. salt <br>

</menu>

Add sugar and shortening to hot water, stir until sugar is dissolved,
and allow to cool until barely warm. <p>

Sift remaining dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl, and gradually
stir in sugar mixture. Mix well and gradually draw dough together with
your hands. It should be soft, but not sticky. 
On a floured board, knead dough about 5-8 minutes, or until smooth and
elastic. Return to bowl, cover with damp cloth and let rise at least 1
hour.
