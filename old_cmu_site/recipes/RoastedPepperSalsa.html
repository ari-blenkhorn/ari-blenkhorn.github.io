<!-- Ingredients list -->
<menu>
2 medium tomatoes<br>
1 small yellow onion<br>
1 small red onion<br>
1 green bell pepper<br>
1 yellow bell pepper<br>
1 small can (4 oz?) tomato sauce<br>
1 fresh jalapeno pepper<br>
4 Tbsp cider vinegar<br>
chopped fresh cilantro<br>
dash of garlic powder<p>
</menu>

<!-- Directions.  Can be paragraphs or a numbered list, depending -->
<!-- on your level of anal-retentiveness.  :-)  -->

Remove stems, seeds and white "ribs" from bell peppers. Cut the
peppers into 1-inch wide strips.  Place strips skin side up on a
cookie tray.  Broil until skins turn brown and bubble away from the
pepper flesh.  Let the peppers cool uncovered.  
<P>

While the peppers cool, chop the rest of the vegetables, discarding
the tomato seeds (they make the salsa gritty &amp; watery).  Mix the
chopped vegetables, tomato sauce, vinegar, cilantro, and garlic powder
in a big bowl.  
<P> 

With your fingernails or a small sharp knife, remove the skin from the
roasted pepper strips.  Chop the pepper strips and add them to the
salsa.
