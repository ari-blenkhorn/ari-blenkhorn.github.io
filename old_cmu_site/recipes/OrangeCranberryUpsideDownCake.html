Drop orange slices and cranberries into boiling water, reboil, drain,
and set aside.  Combine 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 oz. butter and 1 Tbsp
water.  Heat, stirring until blended.  Pour into buttered 9" nonstick
cake pan.  Sift together flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.  Melt
4 oz. butter in a saucepan.  Remove from heat and beat in milk, egg,
and extracts.  Combine with flour mixture and beat until smooth.
Place orange slices in cake pan and fill spaces with cranberries.
Sprinkle 1/4 cup brown sugar evenly over fruit, then spoon cake
mixture on top.  Bake in 350 degree oven until golden and a toothpick
comes out clean, 35-40 min.  Cool 6-8 min, then invert onto serving
plate.  Serve warm with whipped cream.
