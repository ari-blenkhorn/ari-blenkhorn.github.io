    1 spice or German chocolate cake mix<br>
    1 white cake mix<br>
    1 pkg white sandwich cookies<br>
    1 large pkg  vanilla instant pudding mix<br>
    green food coloring<br>
    12 small Tootsie Rolls<br>

    1 new pooper scooper<p>
</menu>



Prepare cake mixes and bake according to directions (any size
pans). <P>

 Prepare pudding mix and chill until ready to assemble.  Crumble
white sandwich cookies in small batches in blender, they tend to
stick, so scrape often. Set aside all but about 1/4 cup. To the 1/4
cup cookie crumbs, add a few drops green food coloring and mix using a
fork or shake in a jar. <P>

 When cakes are cooled to room temperature, crumble into a large
bowl. Toss with half the remaining white cookie crumbs and the chilled
pudding. You probably won't need all of the pudding. Mix it with the
cake and feel it; you don't want it soggy, just moist. Gently combine. <P>

Line new, clean kitty litter box. Put mixture into litter box.  <P>

Put three unwrapped Tootsie rolls in a microwave safe dish and
heat until soft and pliable. Shape ends so they are no longer blunt,
curving slightly. Repeat with 3 more Tootsie rolls and bury in
mixture. <P>

Sprinkle the other half of cookie crumbs over top. Scatter the
green cookie crumbs lightly over the top, this is supposed to look
like the chlorophyll in kitty litter. <P>

Heat remaining Tootsie Rolls, 3 at a time in the microwave until
almost melted. Scrape them on top of the cake and sprinkle with cookie
crumbs. Or, only spread 5 of the remaining Tootsie Rolls over the top;
take one and heat until pliable, hang it over the side of the kitty
litter box; sprinkling it lightly with cookie crumbs. <P>

 Place the box on a newspaper and sprinkle a few of the cookie
crumbs around.  Serve with a new pooper scooper.
