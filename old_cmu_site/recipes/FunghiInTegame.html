<menu>
2 1/2 pounds firm white mushrooms<br>
1/2 oz. dried porcini mushrooms<br>
1/2 cup warm water<br>
6 Tbsp olive oil<br>
2 Tbsp coarsely chopped Italian parsley<br>
1/4 tsp dried savory<br>
3 large cloves garlic, whole (do not mince)<br>
salt<br>
freshly ground black pepper<p>
</menu>

Trim, wash, and drain mushrooms.  Cut the larger ones into halves or
four pieces and leave the smaller ones whole. <P>

Soak the dried mushrooms in 1/2 cup of warm water for 5 to 10 minutes.
Lift them from their bath with a fork, reserving the water.  Remove
and discard any parts that still have some dirt attached to them.
Place in a non-metallic saucepan with the fresh mushrooms. Add the
oil, parsley, savory, garlic, and small amounts of salt and
pepper. <P>

Carefully pour in the reserved water from the soaked mushrooms, making
sure that any sand remains at the bottom of the cup.  Cook uncovered
over low heat for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the liquid is reduced to
a few tablespoons.  Discard the three garlic cloves and serve.
