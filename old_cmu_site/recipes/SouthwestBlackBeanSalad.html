<!-- Ingredients list -->
<menu>
2 cans black beans (you can cook dried beans if you prefer.  A 1 pound
bag)<br>
2-3 cups cooked corn (I usually use frozen)<br>
6-10 cloves garlic (depending on how much you love garlic)<br>
2 bell peppers (one red one green looks festive)<br>
1/2 cup olive oil<br>
1/2 cup fresh squeezed lime juice (or to taste, I often use about 3-4 small
limes)<br>
2-3 tsp whole cumin seeds or 1 to 1 1/2 tsp ground cumin<br>
1/2 cup minced cilantro<br>
1/2 cup minced parsley (optional)<br>
1/2 cup minced red onion (optional)<br>
crushed red pepper to taste<br>
black pepper and salt to taste<p>
</menu>
Mix it all together. It's best when it can sit at least a few hours,
and overnight in the fridge really blends the flavors.
