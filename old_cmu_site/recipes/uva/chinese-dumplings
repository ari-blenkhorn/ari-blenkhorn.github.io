Fatfree chinese dumplings 


Ingredients:
Two cups shredded veggies. Mixture of: mostly cabbage or bok choy,
with carrots, mushrooms, onion, whatever to taste. Pre-packaged
coleslaw mix works surprisingly well. 

soy sauce
water
vinegar (white or rice)
coupla dozen wonton/dumpling skins ( I think these are just flour and water)
garlic (fresh, chopped fine,  or powdered)
ginger (fresh, chopped fine,  or powdered)
small bowl with water for dipping
optional: Tbsp Hunan chili paste, Tbsp plum sauce
          or maybe  tsp black bean sauce, tsp five spice powder or other 
          flavoring (use *one*)

Make the dipping sauce first and let it sit. Mix equal parts soy
sauce and vinegar, about 1/8 cup per person. Mix equal parts garlic
and ginger, about a clove's worth per person.

Stir-fry vegetable mix in a small bit of water and soy sauce. 
If you have it, add your favorite optional flavoring. I like chili paste.
Stir until translucent. Mix will taste sorta raw.

To make the dumplings, scoop about 1.5 teaspoons onto a dumpling skin
(experiment until you find the right amount.) Crunch the dumpling
into a nice shape and dip the end into the small bowl to seal it.

Dumplings may be boiled for 3-5 minutes or steamed 5-10. They are 
done when they crinkle up and turn translucent.

Dip dumplings in sauce. Magic!
