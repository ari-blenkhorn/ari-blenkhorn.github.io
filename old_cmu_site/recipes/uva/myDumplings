Hmmm.... I do it differently each time, but here's an annotated
approximation:

FILLING

1/2 lb. meat:			Ground chicken or turkey works well.
				Pork & shrimp are more common in 
				restaurants but I haven't tried them
				at home. Firm tofu works too.
2 egg whites
1 spoonful corn starch
3 spoonsful water
chopped scallions
crushed ginger & garlic:	I like spicy, so I use 3-4 big cloves
				of garlic and a chunk of ginger about
				the size of my thumb.

Run all this through a food processor.  Especially if you're using
tofu, stir in (but don't food-process) bok choy, water chestnuts,
bamboo shoots, or other crunchy stuff.  You can alter the meat-veggie
balance a great deal, as long as you've got enough meat/egg/cornstarch
mix to hold the veggies together so's you have a solid ball of filling
when it's cooked.

You can make wrappers by hand but it's a real pain.  Buy the circular
ones if you can.  Drop a spoonful of filling in the middle, wet the
edges, fold it over and seal it.  Be careful not to let the dumplings
touch each other as you set them aside, they'll stick.  Steam or boil
in small batches for a few minutes.

SAUCE

equal parts soy sauce (use less if it's strong) and vinegar (white
vinegar is ok, rice vinegar is nice, so is spicy vinegar.  I make some
with red peppers in it.)

a little bit of sesame oil -- not much, the flavor's strong and you
don't want oily sauce

add until you like the flavor...
crushed red pepper
ginger
garlic
lots of ginger
chopped scallions
more ginger
