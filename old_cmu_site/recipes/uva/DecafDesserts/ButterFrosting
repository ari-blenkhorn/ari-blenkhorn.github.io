BUTTER FROSTING
(enough for top & sides of 2-layer round cake)

6 Tbsp butter
4 1/2 to 4 3/4 c powdered sugar
1/4 c milk
1 1/2 tsp vanilla

In a small mixer bowl beat butter until light and fluffy.  Gradually
add about half of the powdered sugar, beating well.  Beat in the milk
and vanilla.  Gradually beat in the remaining powdered sugar, then
additional milk, if necessary, to make frosting of spreading
consistency.
