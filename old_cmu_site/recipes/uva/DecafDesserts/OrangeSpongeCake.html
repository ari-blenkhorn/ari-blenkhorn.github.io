<menu>
    1 1/4 c all-purpose flour<br>
    1 1/2 c sugar, divided<br>
    6 eggs, separated<br>
    1 Tbsp grated orange peel<br>
    1/2 c orange juice<br>
    1 tsp cream of tartar<p>
</menu>

Combine flour and 1/3 c sugar.  In a small mixer bowl, beat egg yolks
at high speed 6 minutes or until thick.  Combine orange peel and
juice; add to yolks, beating at low speed until combined.  Gradually
add 2/3 c sugar and salt, beating at medium speed until sugar
dissolves.  Gradually add 1/4 of the flour mixture to yolk mixture,
beating at low speed until combined.  Repeat with remaining flour, 1/4
at a time, beating a total of 2 minutes.  Thoroughly wash beaters.
Combine egg whites and cream of tartar; beat at medium speed until
soft peaks form.  Gradually add remaining 1/2 c sugar, beating until
stiff peaks form.  Stir 1 c of the whites into yolk mixture.  By hand,
fold yolk mixture into remaining whites.  Turn into an un greased
10-inch tube pan.  Bake at 325 about 60 minutes.  Invert cake in pan
and cool completely.  Loosen cake from pan before removing.
