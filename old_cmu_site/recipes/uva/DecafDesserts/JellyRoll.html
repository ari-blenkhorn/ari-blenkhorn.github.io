<menu>
    1/2 c all-purpose flour<br>
    1 tsp baking powder<br>
    1/4 tsp salt<br>
    4 eggs, separated<br>
    1/2 tsp vanilla<br>
    5/6 c granulated sugar, divided<br>
    sifted powdered sugar<br>
    1/2 c jelly, jam, or other filling<p>
</menu>

Grease and lightly flour a 15x10x1 jelly roll pan.  Stir together
flour, baking powder, and salt.  In a small mixer bowl beat egg yolks
and vanilla at high speed 5 minutes until thick and lemon colored.
Gradually add 1/3 c sugar, beating until sugar dissolves.  Thoroughly
wash beaters.  In large mixer bowl, beat egg whites at medium speed
until soft peaks form.  Gradually add remaining 1/2 c sugar.
Continue beating until stiff peaks form., Fold yolk mixture into
whites.  Sprinkle flour mixture over egg mixture; fold in gently, just
till combined.  Spread batter evenly into pan.  Bake at 375 for 12 to
15 minutes or until done.  Immediately loosen edges of cake from pan
and turn out onto a towel sprinkled with sifted powdered sugar.
Starting with narrow end, roll warm cake and towel together (towel
keeps cake from sticking to itself).  Cool on a wire rack.  Unroll
cake and spread it with jelly, jam, or other filling to within 1 inch
of edges.  Roll up the cake and refrigerate (freeze if filling
requires).<p>
