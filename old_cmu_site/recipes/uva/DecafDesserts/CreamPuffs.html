<i>(makes about 10 puffs)</i><br>
<i>Ari Rapkin</i><p>

<menu>
    1/2 c butter or margarine<br>
    1 c water<br>
    1 c flour<br>
    1/4 tsp salt<br>
    4 eggs<p>
</menu>

Melt butter in a medium saucepan.  Add water and bring to a boil.  Add
flour and salt all at once, stirring vigorously.  Cook and stir until
mixture forms a ball that doesn't separate.  Remove from heat.  Cool
slightly, about 5 minutes.  Add eggs, one at a time, beating with a
wooden spoon after each, for 1 to 2 minutes.  Drop batter by heaping
tablespoon 3 inches apart onto greased baking sheet.  Bake at 400 for
about 30 minutes or until golden brown and puffy.  Remove from oven,
split, and remove any soft dough inside.  Cool on wire rack.  Fill
with whipped cream, pudding, ice cream, or other fillings.
