FROZEN LIME PIE

CRUST
1 1/4 c graham cracker crumbs
1/4 c sugar
1/2 stick unsalted butter, melted

Mix crumbs with sugar.  Add butter and stir until butter is evenly
distributed.  Mixture will not hold together.  Turn mixture into a
9-inch glass pie plate.  Press crumbs against pan to form a compact
crust.  Bake at 350 for 10 minutes, then cool to room temperature
while preparing filling.

FILLING
5 large eggs, separated
3/4 c sugar, divided
2/3 c fresh lime juice
finely grated rind of 2 limes
1/8 tsp salt

In a small mixer bowl beat the yolks with 1/2 c of sugar at high speed
for 5 minutes, until the mixture is very pale and thick.  On low
speed, gradually add the lime juice.  Stir in the grated rind.  Turn
the mixture into the top of a large double boiler over shallow hot
water on moderate heat.  Cook for 6 or 7 minutes, stirring constantly
and scraping sides and bottom.  Mixture should reach 175 or 180
degrees, and thicken enough to coat a wooden spoon.  Remove the top of
the double boiler and pour mixture into a large mixing bowl.  Stir
occasionally until it cools.  In a large mixer bowl, add the salt to
the egg whites and beat until soft peaks form.  Reduce speed and
gradually add the remaining 1/4 c sugar.  Increase speed again and
beat until the mixture holds a definite shape, but not until stiff or
dry.  Gradually, in three additions, fold the yolk mixture into the
whites, handling very little and very carefully.  It is not necessary
to fold the first two additions thoroughly.  Turn the mixture into the
crust.  It will look too full, but just mound it high.  Bake for 15
minutes until the top is lightly browned.  Cool on a rack to room
temperature, then freeze.  When frozen, cover with plastic wrap.  The
pie may be kept frozen for up to 3 weeks.  Serve frozen.
