WHITE CHOCOLATE/AMARETTO CHEESECAKE

CRUST: Use butter cookie or brown sugar cookie dough to make a
crust. Or make a crumb crust using the recipe below, from bread crumbs
(w/ sugar and butter), already-baked cookies, or plain old graham crackers.

Graham cracker crust:

1/2 c butter
1 1/5 c graham crumbs
3 T sugar

Melt butter.  Mix in the remaining ingredients.  Press into 10 inch
springform pan. (Or split into two 6-inches.)


CHEESECAKE: 
350 degree oven

1 1/2 c. sugar *
1 1/2 lbs (3 pkgs) softened cream cheese
3 eggs
8-9 oz. good quality white chocolate **
3 T heavy cream
1 c. sour cream
1/4 c. amaretto

 * (You'll probably want a litle less, since the white chocolate and
    amaretto are both sweet. Try 1 c. and taste batter.)
 ** (Tobler Narcisse, Lindt, Valhrona white chocolate couverture,
     Callebaut, etc.)

Beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar.  Beat in eggs
one at a time. Melt white chocolate with heavy cream (in double boiler
or in microwave, but if using microwave, stop and stir every 20
seconds). Beat white chocolate, amaretto, and sour cream into
batter. Beat a while longer.  Bake in preheated oven 55-60 minutes. If
top starts to become too brown, cover w/ foil partway through baking.
Or refrigerate cake and just slice top off cheesecake when cool.
(Then you get to sample the cake (quality assurance) before serving it
to guests :)

TOPPING:
1 c. sour cream
1 c. confectioner's sugar

Whisk together. Add a touch of amaretto or vanilla.  Spoon over top of
cake, letting some drip over the sides.

Serve w/ fresh fruit, if desired.
