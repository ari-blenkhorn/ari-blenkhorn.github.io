<menu>
    1/4 c butter<br>
    2 pkgs. active dry yeast<br>
    1 3/4 c water  (105-115 degrees F)<br>
    1/2 c buttermilk<br>
    8 Tbsp sugar<br>
    2 tsp ground cinnamon<br>
    2 eggs<br>
    1 c whole wheat flour<br>
    4 c all-purpose flour<br>
    4-6 apples<br>
    2 Tbsp sesame seed<p>
</menu>

Melt butter.  In a bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Add
buttermilk, melted butter, 6 Tbsp sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 egg, and
whole wheat flour.  Stir to blend.  Add the all-purpose flour.  Knead
dough until smooth and elastic, then let rise in a warm place for
about 40 minutes.  Punch down.  Peel apples and cut them into wedges.
On a floured board, knead dough until satiny.  Divide into 3 parts.
Roll each out into a rectangle.  Cut each rectangle into 10 squares.
Place one apple wedge in the middle of each square.  Combine remaining
sugar and cinnamon.  Sprinkle mixture over apple wedges.  Fold dough
over apples to cover completely.  Place rolls on a greased baking
sheet, seam-side down.  Brush with beaten egg, then sprinkle with
sesame seed.  Bake at 400 for about 8 minutes.  Increase temperature
to 425 and bake for another 4 minutes until golden brown.  Cover and
cool on a wire rack.<p>

<i>FREEZING:</i>
These apple rolls freeze well.  Wrap in small batches.  Thaw before
re-heating at 350.
