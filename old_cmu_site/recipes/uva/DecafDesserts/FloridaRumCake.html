<menu>
    2 1/2 c sifted all-purpose flour<br>
    2 tsp baking powder<br>
    1 tsp baking soda<br>
    1/2 tsp salt<br>
    2 sticks unsalted butter<br>
    1 c granulated sugar<br>
    2 eggs<br>
    1 c buttermilk<br>
    grated rind of 1 large lemon<br>
    grated rind of 2 large oranges<br>
    1 cup walnuts, chopped<br>
<br>
<b>Glaze:</b>
    3 Tbsp lemon juice<br>
    1/2 c orange juice<br>
    1 c granulated sugar<br>
    5 Tbsp dark rum<p>
</menu>

Butter an 8 to 10-cup bundt pan.  Dust the pan with fine, dry bread
crumbs and tap out excess.  Sift together flour, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt.  Set aside.  In large mixer bowl, beat the butter
until soft.  Add sugar, beating well.  Add the eggs, one at a time,
beating well after each.  On low speed, add the dry ingredients
alternately with buttermilk, beating only until smooth after each
addition.  Stir in the rinds and then the nuts.  Turn into prepared
pan and smooth the top.  Bake at 350, on a rack 1/3 up from the bottom
of the oven, for 55 to 60 minutes or until the top springs back sharply
when it is lightly pressed with a fingertip. <p>

Meanwhile, prepare the glaze.  Place both juices and sugar in a small saucepan
over moderate or high heat.  Stir with a wooden spatula until sugar dissolves
and mixture comes to a low boil.  Remove from heat and stir in the rum.  <p>

When cake is done, set it on a rack to cool.  Pierce all over
the top with a cake tester or toothpick.  Spoon the hot glaze over the
cake about a Tbsp at a time.  When about half the glaze has been
added, use a small spatula or knife to ease the sides of the cake away
from the pan so that glaze can run downward.  Continue adding the
glaze and releasing the sides until all the glaze has been absorbed.
Let stand for about 10 minutes, until the bottom of the pan has
cooled.  Then invert onto plate.  Bang plate & pan against work
surface if necessary to release cake.  Let stand for a few hours, then
cover with plastic wrap.  Let stand overnight.  Cut into thick slices.
