<menu>
    5 c all-purpose flour<br>
    1 1/2 tsp baking soda<br>
    2 tsp ground ginger<br>
    1 tsp cinnamon<br>
    1 tsp ground cloves<br>
    1/2 tsp salt<br>
    1 c shortening<br>
    1 c sugar<br>
    1 egg<br>

</menu>

Stir together flour, baking soda, spices, and salt.  Beat shortening
for 30 seconds.  Add sugar and beat until fluffy.  Add egg, molasses,
and vinegar, beating well. Add dry ingredients to beaten mixture,
blending thoroughly.  Cover and chill for 3 hours or overnight.
Divide dough into thirds.  Work with one third at a time, keeping
remainder chilled.  On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to
1/8-inch thickness.  Cut into desired shapes.  Place on greased cookie
sheet.  Bake at 375 for 5 to 6 minutes.  Cool 1 minute before
removing to wire racks.
