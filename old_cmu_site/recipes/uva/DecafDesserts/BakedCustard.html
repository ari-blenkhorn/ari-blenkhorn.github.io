<menu>
    4 eggs<br>
    2 c milk<br>
    1/2 c sugar<br>
    1 tsp vanilla<br>
    nutmeg (optional)<p>
</menu>

In a medium bowl, lightly beat eggs.  Stir in milk, sugar, vanilla,
and salt.  Place a 1-quart casserole or six 6-ounce custard cups in a
13x9x2 baking pan on oven rack.  Pour custard mixture into casserole
or cups.  Sprinkle with nutmeg, if desired.  Pour boiling water into
the pan around casserole or custard cups to a depth of 1 inch.  Bake
at 325 for 50 to 60 minutes for the 1-quart casserole, 30 to 40
minutes for the custard cups, or until a knife inserted near center
comes out clean.  Serve warm or chilled.  To unmold chilled individual
custards, first loosen edges with a spatula or knife, then invert onto
serving plate.<p>
