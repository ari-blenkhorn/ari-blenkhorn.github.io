BUTTERMILK LOAF CAKE
3 c sifted all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp salt
2 sticks unsalted butter
1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
2 c sugar
4 large eggs
1 c buttermilk
finely grated rind of 2 or 3 lemons

Butter a 10-cup loaf pan.  Dust with fine, dry bread crumbs, and tap
out excess crumbs.  Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda,
and salt.  Set aside.  In a large mixer bowl, cream the butter.  Beat
in vanilla.  Add sugar and beat only until well mixed.  Add the eggs
one at a time, beating only until incorporated.  Beat for about 1
minute more.  On low speed, add the dry ingredients alternately with
the buttermilk, beating until incorporated after each addition.  Stir
in grated rind.  Turn into prepared pan and shake the pan a bit to
level.  Bake at 325, on a rack 1/3 up from bottom of oven, for 1 hour
and 30 to 35 minutes, or until cake tests done.  The top will be
richly brown.  Let cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes.  Invert onto
a rack, then again onto first rack, so that cake cools upright without
the pan.  Wrap and refrigerate (or freeze for about an hour) before serving.
