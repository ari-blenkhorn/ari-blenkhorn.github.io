TAPIOCA FLUFF PUDDING
1/2 c sugar			4 c milk
1/4 c quick-cooking tapioca	3 eggs, separated
1/4 tsp salt			1 1/2 tsp vanilla

In a heavy large saucepan, combine sugar, tapioca, and salt.  Stir in
milk and let stand for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, beat egg yolks slightly.
Stir yolks into tapioca mixture.  Bring to a full boil, stirring
constantly.  Remove from heat.  Stir in vanilla.  Beat egg whites
until stiff peaks form.  Put 1/3 of the whites into a large bowl.
