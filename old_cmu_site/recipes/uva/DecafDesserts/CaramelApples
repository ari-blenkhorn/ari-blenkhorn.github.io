CARAMEL APPLES
14 small tart apples		dash salt
1/2 c butter or margarine	1 14-oz can (1 1/4 c) sweetened condensed milk
2 c packed brown sugar		1 tsp vanilla
1 c light corn syrup

Wash and dry apples.  Remove stems.  Insert a wooden skewer into the
stem end of each apple.  Melt butter in a heavy 3-quart saucepan.
Stir in sugar, corn syrup, and salt.  Bring to boiling over medium
heat, stirring constantly.  Stir in condensed milk.  Cook, stirring
constantly, to 245 (firm ball stage), for 12 to 15 minutes.  Mixture
should boil gently over entire surface.  Remove from heat and add
vanilla.  Dip each apple into caramel mixture, turning to coat
completely.  Set on a buttered baking sheet and chill.
