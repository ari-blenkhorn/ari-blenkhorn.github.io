GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST
1 1/4 c graham cracker crumbs
1/4 c sugar
1/2 stick unsalted butter, melted

Mix crumbs with sugar.  Add butter and stir until butter is evenly
distributed.  Mixture will not hold together.  Turn mixture into a
9-inch glass pie plate.  Press crumbs against pan to form a compact
crust.  Bake at 350 for 10 minutes, then cool to room temperature
