Peel & slice apples.  Toss with lemon juice, brown sugar, spice, and
lemon peel.  In another bowl, combine bread crumbs and margarine.
Press 1/3 of bread crumb mixture into the bottom of a buttered baking
dish.  Cover with 1/2 of the apples.  Continue layering the rest of
the crumbs and apples.  Bake covered with foil at 350 for about 40
minutes.  Increase heat to 400 and bake uncovered for 10 minutes or
until lightly browned.
