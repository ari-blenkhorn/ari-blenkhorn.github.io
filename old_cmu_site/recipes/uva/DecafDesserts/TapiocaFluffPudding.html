<menu>
1/2 c sugar<br>
1/4 c quick-cooking tapioca<br>
1/4 tsp salt<br>
4 c milk<br>

</menu>

In a heavy large saucepan, combine sugar, tapioca, and salt.  Stir in
milk and let stand for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, beat egg yolks slightly.
Stir yolks into tapioca mixture.  Bring to a full boil, stirring
constantly.  Remove from heat.  Stir in vanilla.  Beat egg whites
until stiff peaks form.  Put 1/3 of the whites into a large bowl.
Slowly stir in the tapioca mixture.  Fold in remaining egg whites,
leaving little fluffs of unblended egg white.  Cover and chill.  Serve
topped with whipped cream or fruit.
