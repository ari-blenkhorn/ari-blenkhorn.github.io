<menu>
    1/4 c soft unsalted butter<br>
    1/3 c sugar<br>
    few drops vanilla<br>
    pinch salt<br>
    2 egg whites, room temperature<br>
    1/3 c flour<p>
</menu>

Cream the butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt until fluffy.  Beat in the
egg whites just enough to blend them, and then the flour only until
mixed -- do not overbeat.  Butter and flour a baking sheet.  Using a
pastry bag with a plain round 3/8-inch opening, pipe out tongues
about 1/2 inch apart.  Hold the tip almost vertical to the baking
sheet and very close to it so that you get a very thin layer of
batter.  Bake at 425 for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the cookies have
browned lightly around the edges but are paler in the center.  Remove
them immediately to a cooling rack.  If they harden before you can
take them off the sheet, return the pan to the oven briefly to soften
them again.  Store in an airtight container.
