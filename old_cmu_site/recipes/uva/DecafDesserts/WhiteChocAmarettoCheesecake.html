<i>Notes: (1) You'll probably want less than 1 1/2 cups of sugar since the white
chocolate &amp; the Amaretto are both sweet.  Add 1 cup, taste batter,
then add more if needed.
(2) Suggested chocolates: Tobler Narcisse, Lindt, Valhrona white
chocolate couverture, Callebaut, etc.)</i><p>

<b>Cheesecake:</b><br>

a <A HREF="CookieCrumbCrust.html">cookie crumb crust</A>.<p>


<b>Cheesecake:</b>
Beat cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually beat in sugar.  Beat in eggs
one at a time. Melt white chocolate with heavy cream (in double boiler
or in microwave, but if using microwave, stop and stir every 20
seconds). Beat white chocolate, Amaretto, and sour cream into
batter. Beat a while longer.  Bake in preheated 350 degree oven 55-60
minutes. If top starts to become too brown, cover w/ foil part-way
through baking.  Or refrigerate cake and just slice top off cheesecake
when cool.<p>

<b>Topping:</b>

Whisk together. Add a touch of Amaretto or vanilla.  Spoon over top of
cake, letting some drip over the sides.<p>

Serve w/ fresh fruit, if desired.
