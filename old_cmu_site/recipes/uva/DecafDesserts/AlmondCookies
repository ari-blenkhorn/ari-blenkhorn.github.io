ALMOND COOKIES
2 3/4 c all-purpose flour		1 c lard
1 c sugar				1 slightly beaten egg
1/2 tsp baking soda			2 Tbsp milk
1/2 tsp salt				1 tsp almond extract
halved blanched almonds or almond slivers

Stir together flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.  Cut in lard until
mixture resembles cornmeal.  Combine egg, milk, and almond extract.
Add to flour mixture, blending thoroughly.  Shape dough into 1-inch
balls.  Place on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Press an almond half or a
few almond slivers into the top of each cookie, flattening the cookie
slightly.  Bake at 235 for 16 to 18 minutes.  Cool on a wire rack.
