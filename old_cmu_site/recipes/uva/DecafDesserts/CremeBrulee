CREME BRULEE
3 slightly beaten eggs		1/4 tsp salt
2 cups light cream		1/2 tsp vanilla
1/4 c sugar			1/2 c packed brown sugar

In a heavy 2-quart sauceppan combine the beaten eggs, light cream,
sugar, and salt.  Cook and stir over medium heat for about 10 minutes
or until custard coats a metal spoon.  Remove from heat.  Cool at once
by placing pan in a sink or bowl of ice water and stirring 1 to 2
minutes.  Stir in vanilla.  Pour into a 1-quart casserole and
refrigerate at least 2 hours.  Press brown sugar through a sieve over
the custard.  Set the casserole in a pan of ice cubes and cold water.
Broil 4 to 5 inches from heat for 1 to 2 minutes or until sugar turns
golden brown and a bubbly crust forms.  Serve warm or chilled.
