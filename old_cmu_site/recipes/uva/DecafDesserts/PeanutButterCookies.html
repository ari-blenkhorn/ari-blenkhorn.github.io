Stir together flour, baking soda, and slat.  In a mixer bowl, beat
butter for 30 seconds.  Add peanut butter and sugars, beating until
fluffy.  Add egg and vanilla, beating well.  Add dry ingredients to
beaten mixture, and blend thoroughly.  Shape dough into 1-inch balls,
and roll in granulated sugar if desired.  Place on ungreased cookie
sheet and criss-cross by pressing with tines of a fork.  Bake at 375
