<menu>
    1 1/2 c sifted powdered sugar<br>
    1 c sifted cake flour (can use all-purpose)<br>
    1 1/2 c egg whites (11 or 12 large)<br>
    1 1/2 tsp cream of tartar<br>
    1 tsp vanilla<br>
    1/4 tsp salt<br>
    1 c granulated sugar<p>
</menu>

Sift together powdered sugar and flour.  Repeat twice more.  In a
large mixer bowl beat egg whites, cream of tartar, vanilla, and salt
at medium speed until soft peaks form.  Gradually add granulated
sugar, about 2 Tbsp at a time.  Continue beating until stiff peaks
form.  Sift about 1/4 of the flour mixture over white, and fold in
lightly by hand.  If bowl is too full, transfer to larger bowl.  Fold
in remaining flour mixture by fourths.  Turn into an ungreased 10-inch
tube pan.  Bake at 350 on lowest rack for 40 minutes or until cake
tests done.  Invert cake in pan and cool completely.  Loosen cake from
pan before removing.
