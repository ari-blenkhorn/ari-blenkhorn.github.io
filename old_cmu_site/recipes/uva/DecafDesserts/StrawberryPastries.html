Roll each sheet of dough out to about 12x6 inches.  If desired, sift
powdered sugar over counter before rolling.  Cut each sheet into 4
even pieces.  Cover baking sheets with waxed paper.  Place dough on
prepared sheet.  Prick with a fork.  Sift powdered sugar over dough.
Refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Bake dough at 425 for about 5 minutes.
Increase temperature to 450 and bake for another 3 to 5 minutes until
pastries are light, golden, and puffed.  Let cool on wire rack.
Prepare Vanilla Custard.  Spread over half of the baked pastries.
Cover with sliced strawberries.  Top with second half of pastries.
Dust with powdered sugar.
