PECAN TASSIES
1/2 c + 1 Tbsp butter or margarine	3/4 c packed brown sugar
3 oz cream cheese			1 tsp vanilla
1 c all-purpose flour			dash salt
1 egg					1/2 c coarsely chopped pecans

For pastry, beat 1/2 c butter or margarine with cream cheese.  Add
flour, beating well.  Cover bowl and chill for about 1 hour.  In a
small mixing bowl, combine egg, brown sugar, 1 Tbsp butter, vanilla,
and salt, blending just until smooth.  Set egg mixture aside.  Shape
chilled pastry dough into 2 dozen 1-inch balls.  Place each ball in an
ungreased 1 3/4-inch muffin cup, pressing the dough onto the bottom
and sides of the cup.  Spoon about 1 tsp of pecans into each pastry
cup, and fill with egg mixture.  Bake at 325 for 25 minutes or until
filling is set.  Cool on wire racks before removing from pans.
