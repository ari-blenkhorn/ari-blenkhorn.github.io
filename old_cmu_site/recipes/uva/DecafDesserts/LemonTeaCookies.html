<b>Notes:</b> <i> 
(1) I wasn't thrilled with the glaze. It was difficult to work with,
and just soaked into the cookies, which became sticky-topped and
mushy.  Maybe powdered sugar would work better, possibly with
some cornstarch too.

(2) The amount of lemon peel specified gives a delicate lemon flavor. 
If you like strong lemony flavor, you should add more peel.</i><br>

<menu>
    1/4 c + 2 tsp lemon juice<br>
    1/2 c milk<br>
    1 3/4 c all-purpose flour<br>
    1 tsp baking powder<br>
    1/4 tsp baking soda<br>
    1/4 tsp salt<br>
    1/2 c butter or margarine<br>
    1 1/2 c sugar, divided<br>
    1 egg<br>
    1 tsp finely shredded lemon peel<p>
</menu>

Stir 2 tsp lemon juice into milk; set aside.  Stir together flour,
baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Beat butter for 30 seconds.
Add 3/4 c sugar and beat until fluffy.  Add egg and lemon peel, beating
well.  Add dry ingredients and milk alternately, beating after each
addition.  Drop by teaspoons onto an ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake at
350 for 12 to 14 minutes.  Stir remaining 3/4 c sugar into remaining
1/4 c lemon juice to make glaze.  Remove cookies from cookie sheet
immediately when done, and brush with glaze.
