BASIC WHITE FROSTING
(enough for top & sides of 2-layer round cake)

1 c shortening			4 1/2 to 4 3/4 c powdered sugar
1 1/2 tsp vanilla		3 to 4 Tbsp milk, divided
1/2 tsp lemon extract

Beat shortening, vanilla, and lemon extract at medium speed for 30
seconds.  Gradually add about half of the powdered sugar, beating
well.  Add 2 Tbsp of milk.  Gradually beat in the remaining powdered
sugar and enough milk to make the frosting of spreading consistency.

Add more powdered sugar to stiffen frosting if it is to be used for
decorative shapes (flowers, borders, etc.).
