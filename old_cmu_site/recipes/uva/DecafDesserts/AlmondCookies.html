<menu>
2 3/4 c all-purpose flour<br>
1 c sugar<br>
1/2 tsp baking soda<br>
1/2 tsp salt<br>
1 c lard<br>
1 slightly beaten egg<br>

</menu>

Stir together flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.  Cut in lard until
mixture resembles cornmeal.  Combine egg, milk, and almond extract.
Add to flour mixture, blending thoroughly.  Shape dough into 1-inch
balls.  Place on an ungreased cookie sheet.  Press an almond half or a
few almond slivers into the top of each cookie, flattening the cookie
slightly.  Bake at 235 for 16 to 18 minutes.  Cool on a wire rack.
