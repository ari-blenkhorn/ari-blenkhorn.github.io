1 vanilla bean<br>
1 c half-and-half<br>
3 egg yolks<br>
3 Tbsp granulated sugar<br>
1/2 c whipping cream<p>
</menu>

Split vanilla bean open lengthwise and place in a heavy saucepan.  Add
half-and-half.  Bring to a boil and cook over medium-low heat for
about 10 minutes.  Remove vanilla bean.  In a bowl, beat egg yolks and
sugar until smooth and creamy.  Add a little hot half-and-half,
whisking.  Pour this mixture back into saucepan.  Bring to a boil,
whisking constantly until thick and creamy.  Do not boil or custard
will curdle.  Remove custard sauce from heat.  Beat until cool.  Whip
cream until soft peaks form, then add to custard.
