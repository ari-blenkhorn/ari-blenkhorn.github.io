<menu>
    1 cup butter or margarine<br>
    4 eggs<br>
    2 cup all-purpose flour<br>
    1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
    1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
    1/4 teaspoon nutmeg<br>
    1 cup sugar<br>
    1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla<p>
</menu>

Bring butter and eggs to room temperature.  Grease and lightly flour a
loaf pan.  Stir together flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.  In a
large mixer bowl beat the butter or margarine at medium speed for
about 30 seconds.  Gradually add sugar, beating 6 minutes or until
fluffy.  Add vanilla.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating 1 minute
after each and scraping bowl frequently.  Gradually add dry
ingredients to butter mixture, beating at low speed just until
thoroughly combined.  Turn batter into pan.  Bake at 325 for 55 to 65
minutes or until cake tests done.  Cool 15 minutes in pan.  Remove
from pan and cool on wire rack.
