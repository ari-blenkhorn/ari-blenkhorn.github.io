LACE COOKIES
1/4 c whole unblanched almonds		1 1/2 tsp flour
1/4 c unsalted butter		few drops vanilla
1/4 c sugar		pinch salt
1 Tbsp whipping cream		baking parchment

Chop the almonds very fine, preferably by hand. Shake them in a strainer to remove any dust 
before measuring. Put the nuts in a small, heavy non-corroding saucepan with the butter, sugar, 
cream, flour, and flavorings. Stir over low heat until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is 
smooth. Set aside and cut baking parchment to fit your baking sheet. You might be able to make 
these cookies on a buttered and floured pan, but it would be difficult. Also, these cookies need a 
flat surface to spread out on, so it is very important that you use a baking sheet that will not flex in 
the oven. Drop the batter by leavel teaspoons onto the parchment, allowing 4 inches between 
cookies. When you bake successive batches, use a new piece of parchment for each one or your 
cookies will have odd shapes. Bake at 375 for 4 to 6 minutes or until the cookies are caramel 
colored. Take the sheet from the oven and slide the parchment off it. The cookies need to cool 
briefly so you can handle them. As soon as they are stiff enough to pick up, roll them quickly 
around the handle of a wooden spoon with the top side of the cookie facing out. Set on a rack to 
cool. If they stiffen too much to roll while you work on them, set them back on the warm baking 
sheet and put it back in oven long enough to soften them. Continue until all have been rolled. The 
cookies can also be left flat and drizzled with melted chocolate just before serving, or pinched into 
tortellini-like shapes.
