<menu>
    2 c sugar<br>
    1 c light corn syrup<br>
    1 c water<br>

</menu>

Butter the sides of a 2-quart saucepan.  In it combine sugar, corn
syrup, water, and salt.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly,
until sugar is dissolved.  Continue cooking to 265 (hard ball stage),
without stirring.  Mixture should boil gently over entire surface.
Remove from heat.  Stir in butter or margarine.  Add flavoring and
food coloring, if desired.  Pour into a buttered 15x10x1 inch pan.
Cool about 20 minutes or till easily handled.  Butter hands and pull
candy until difficult to pull.  Cut into fourths.  Pull each piece
into a long strip about 1/2" thick.  With buttered scissors, cut taffy
into bite-sized pieces.  Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and store
overnight.
