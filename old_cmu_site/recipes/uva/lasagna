A box of lasagna noodles 
1 lb. ground beef
1 big onions or 2 wimpy ones, chopped coarsely
2 cans tomato sauce 
    or 1 and a can of crushed or stewed tomatoes
4 eggs
2 pints of ricotta
1/2 - 3/4 cup parmesan
1/2 lb shredded mozzarella (low-moisture is best)
garlic, parsley, basil, oregano, salt, pepper

waxed paper or aluminum foil

a 9 x 13 x 3 pan -- the deeper the better.  Don't try this in a
shallow cake pan.

Brown the meat & onions.  Drain.  Add the tomato sauce and/or
tomatoes.  Add the garlic.  Cover & simmer.

Boil a lot of water and cook 13 noodles according to the package
directions.  Hopefully you won't need the 13th but I always rip one of
the noodles accidentally.  Don't over-cook the noodles.  They need to
be fairly firm to hold up the weight of all the cheese!  When they're
done, run cold water over them and lay them out flat on waxed paper or
aluminum foil so that they dry off.  You don't want any
liquid in the lasagna that you can avoid.

Mix the eggs, ricotta, parmesan, and about 2/3 of the mozzarella.  Add
basil, parsley, salt, pepper.

Add oregano to the meat & tomato sauce.  Let it cook a few more minutes.

Put a thin layer of sauce in the pan.  Spread it around well.  This is
what keeps the bottom layer of noodles from burning to the pan.  Then:
1.  Put three noodles side-by-side running the length of the pan.
2.  Smear about 1/3 of the cheese onto the noodles.
3.  Spoon about 1/4 of the meat sauce on top of the cheese.

Do this twice more.  Put the last 3 noodles in place, eat the 13th, 
pour the remaining sauce onto the noodles, and cover it with the
mozzarella that you saved earlier.

Cover the pan with aluminum foil.  Bake 30 minutes at 350 degrees,
then take off the foil and bake 10-15 minutes more.  Let the lasagna
cool for about 10 minutes before you try to serve it.

If you're making garlic bread, put it in the oven when you take the
foil off the lasagna.
