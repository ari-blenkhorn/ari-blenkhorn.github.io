<i>Makes 2 cups</i><br>
<i>From the Chocolat cookbook</i><br>
<i>Ari Rapkin</i><p>

<menu>
    16 oz blueberries, fresh or frozen<br>
    2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice, or more to taste<br>
    1/2 cup sugar, or more to taste<p>
</menu>


Combine ingredients in a medium saucepan.  Cover and cook over
medium heat until berry juices are released, about 1-2 minutes.  Stir
to moisten all the berries, cover again, and cook 3 more minutes.
Uncover and cook just until the mixture has come to a full rolling
boil.  Boil for 1 minute.  Cool. <P>

 Adjust flavor with additional teaspoons of sugar and/or drops of
lemon juice. <P>

 Serve as a compote-like sauce, or puree in a food processor (and
strain, if desired) for a more uniform consistency.  Sauce may be made
and refrigerated in a covered container a week ahead, or frozen for 6
months or longer.
