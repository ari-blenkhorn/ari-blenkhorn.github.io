<menu>
    1/2 cup chopped nuts<br>
    1/2 + 2 cups sugar<br>
    2 tsp ground cinnamon<br>
    3 1/2 cup all-purpose flour<br>
    1 tsp baking powder<br>
    1 tsp salt<br>
    1 pint sour cream<br>
    2 tsp baking soda<br>
    1 cup butter or margarine<br>
    4 eggs<br>
    1 tsp vanilla<p>
</menu>

Combine nuts, 1/2 cup sugar, and cinnamon and set aside for topping.
Mix flour, baking powder, and salt.  Combine sour cream and soda.
Cream butter and 2 cups sugar until light and fluffy.  Add eggs one at
a time, beating well after each addition.  Add vanilla.  Gradually add
flour mixture alternately with sour cream mixture, beginning & ending
with flour mixture.  Spoon 2/3 of the batter into a greased 10-inch
tube pan.  Top with 1/2 of the nut mixture.  Add remaining batter and
nut mixture.  Bake at 350 for 1 hour or until cake just begins to pull
away from the sides of the pan.  Cool in pan 15 minutes.  Remove from
pan and finish cooling on rack.
<p>
For more swirled effect, layer batter and topping in equal thirds, and
streak with knife.
