    1 Tbsp sugar<br>
    1/2 tsp salt<br>
    1/4 cup cold butter<br>

Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together into a large bowl.
Cut in butter until small pea sized.  Beat eggs in a separate bowl.
Reserve 2 Tbsp of egg.  Beat cream into the remaining egg.  Make a
well in the dry ingredients.  Pour in the liquid and combine with a
few rapid strokes.  Handle the dough as little as possible.  Place it
on a lightly floured board.  Flour hands, and pat dough to 3/4 inch
thick.  Cut into diamonds, squares, or whatever shapes you want.
Brush with reserved egg and sprinkle with salt or sugar.  Bake 15 minutes
