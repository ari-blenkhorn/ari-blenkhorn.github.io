<i>Makes 2 cups</i><br>
<i>From the Chocolat cookbook</i><br>

<menu>
    12 oz raw cranberries, fresh or frozen<br>
    3/4 cup red seedless or strained raspberry preserves<br>
    3/4 cup sugar.<p>
</menu>


Wash and pick over cranberries.  Drain and combine with sugar in
the bowl of a food processor or blender.  Puree as finely as possible. <P>

 Press the puree through a medium-fine strainer to remove the
toughest skins.  You will end up with about 1/3 cup tough dry pulp and
skins to discard.  Stir strained raspberry preserves into puree.
Sauce may be prepared and refrigerated for at least 3 weeks, or frozen
for 6 months or longer.  Never heat sauce, even to thaw. <P>

 To serve, spoon onto plate next to dessert.
