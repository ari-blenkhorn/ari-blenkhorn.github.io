<i>Ari Rapkin</i><p>

<menu>
    1 cup whole-wheat pastry flour<br>
    1 cup unbleached white flour<br>
    7 to 7 1/2 Tbsp soy margarine, cut into bits<br>
    1/2 tsp grated nutmeg<br>
    dash of salt (optional)<br>
    6 Tbsp ice water or very cold apple juice (especially good for apple pies)<p>
</menu>


Place flours, margarine, nutmeg, and salt in a food processor and
process 10 seconds to a cornmeal texture.  With processor running, add
3 Tbsp ice water.  Add remaining water slowly, and stop the machine as
soon as the dough begins to form a ball.  Tiny pieces of margarine
should be visible in dough. <P>

Form the dough into 2 equal balls and flatten one into a thick
disk.  Flour your work surface and rolling pin, and roll dough from
center out to sides, turning into a perfect circle about 10 inches in
diameter.  (Rolling the dough between two pieces of waxed paper works
pretty well too.  -- Ari) <P>

Place the rolling pin in the center of the dough.  Fold half over
the pin and transfer to a 9-inch pie plate.  Press the dough gently
into the pie plate, fold the rough edges under neatly or trim them.
Wrap second ball of dough in waxed paper and refrigerate (or wrap
tightly and freeze if you're making a single-crust pie -- Ari).  Cover
pie plate with a slightly damp kitchen towel and place in
refrigerator. <P>

Preheat oven and prepare filling as specified for whatever filling
recipe you're using.  After pie is filled, if you're using the second
crust, roll it to a 9-inch circle. Place it over the filling, trim,
and crimp edge with thumb and forefinger or flute with a fork.  Brush
top with melted margarine if desired.
