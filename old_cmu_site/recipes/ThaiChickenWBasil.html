<menu>
    4 oz Thai basil leaves (weighed without stems)<br>
    3 oz shallots, finely chopped<br>
    5 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br>
    1 in cube of ginger, peeled and finely chopped<br>
    8 oz chicken, cooked and shredded<br>
    2 red chilies, de-seeded and finely chopped<br>
    2 green chilies, deseeded and finely chopped<br>
    4 teaspoons Thai fish sauce<p>
</menu>


Heat oil in a wok. When hot, throw a handful of basil leaves in and
cover immediately (since the oil will sizzle and spit). Remove after
only a few seconds and dry on absorbent paper.<p>

Chop remaining basil leaves. <p>

Reheat oil. Fry the garlic and shallots for a few moments. Add
ginger, chilies, chicken and chopped basil. 
Serve with fish sauce poured over and topped with fried basil leaves.
