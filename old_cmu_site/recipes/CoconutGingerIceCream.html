Combine the coconut milk and the cream in a medium saucepan over low
heat.  Heat just until bubbles form around the edges.  Remove from
heat.  In a large bowl, beat the yolks, sugar, and syrup until pale
yellow.  Slowly add the hot milk mixture while stirring.  Transfer to
a clean saucepan and gently heat, stirring constantly, until the
mixture coats the back of a spoon.  Transfer to a clean bowl and stir
in the ginger and the lemon juice.  Chill for 1 hour.  Freeze in an
ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.
