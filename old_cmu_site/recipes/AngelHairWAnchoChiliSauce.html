<i>You can skip the avocados if you like, but the lime juice really
makes the dish.</i><p>

<menu>
4 Ancho chilies, stemmed, seeds and veins removed<br>
2 1/2 c chicken stock<br>
2 whole cloves<br>
1 garlic clove (or more... 4 is recommended)<br>
1/8 tsp cumin seeds<br>
salt<br>
1/4 c olive oil<br>
4 oz fresh angel hair pasta in nests.  Must use the fresh stuff. Dry pasta nests won't work.<br>
1/3 c grated cheese (Romano is good, goat Gouda is even better) <br>
avocados<br>
limes<p>
</menu>



In a non-reactive saucepan, cover the chilies with water and simmer
    5 minutes. Remove from heat. Let them soak for 5 more minutes, then
    drain.<p>

Put 1/4 c chicken stock into a blender/food processor with cloves,
    garlic, cumin. Blend. Season with salt. Add 1 c more stock and 1
    chili at a time, blending to a smooth consistency before adding
    the next. Do this to all the chilies. <p>

Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the pasta, keeping the nests
    intact,  and fry it (very strange, yes), turning the nests until
    they reach a deep golden color. This should only take about 3
    minutes. Ours turned a nice crusty brown. Be sure to keep the
    nests intact. Strain off the oil.<p>

Add the sauce to the pasta. Turn up to moderate heat for about 3
    minutes, scraping the bottom to keep the pasta from sticking.
    Cover. Cook on low, adding the remaining stock a little at a time
    to prevent sticking. Cook another 5-8 minutes. <p>

Serve one nest per person with wedges of avocado and a wedge of
    lime. Squeeze a little bit of the lime and some cheese over the
    nest and eat. <p>
