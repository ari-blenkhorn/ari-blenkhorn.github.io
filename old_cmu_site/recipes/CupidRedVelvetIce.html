Wash cranberries, combine with only 2 cups apple juice and sugar in a
large pot. Cook on high/medium high until cranberries pop (about 8
minutes). Put through a food mill. Add remaining ingredients and
chill. Put this mixture into an electric freezer or a hand cranked
one. Read the directions on your freezer for the time or crank till it
freezes. Serve frozen mixture in champagne glasses.
