<i>Recipe source:  Marilyn Herrera</i><p>

<dd>1 can sweetened condensed milk
<dd>2 teaspoon vanilla<br> 
<dd>3 cups milk<br> 
<dd>3 eggs<br>  
<dd>1 cup sugar (for caramel glaze)<p>

Lightly beat the 3 eggs; add the can of condensed milk, 3 cups milk, 2
teaspoon vanilla. In pan, heat 1 cup sugar until caramelized. Then
coat inside of Jello mold (ring mold) with caramel glaze.  Place mold
in shallow pan of cold water (water should reach 1/2 to 3/4 up side of
mold). Pour milk/egg mixture into ring mold. Bake at 400F for about 1
hour in middle rack. Should appear golden brown on

will fall over flan. For best results, make one day prior to
serving. Should stand 12 hours in refrigerator. <p>
