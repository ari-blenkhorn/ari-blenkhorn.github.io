<menu>
    2.5 cups imported Swiss cheeses (<i>Try a mix of about 2 parts Emmentaler to 1 part Gruyere)</i><br>
    1.5 tablespoons flour<br>
    1   clove garlic<br>
    1   cup dry white wine<br>
    1   jigger Kirsch<br>
    Salt, Pepper, Nutmeg<br>
    French bread cut into big mouthfuls<p>
</menu>

The cheese should be shredded or grated coarsely and mixed well with
the flour. Use a chafing dish for cooking and a small heated casserole
for serving.  Rub the bottom and sides of the blazer well with garlic,
pour in the wine and heat to bubbling, just under boiling.  Add cheese
slowly, half a cup at a time, and stir steadily in one direction only,
as in making Welsh Rabbit.  Use a silver fork.  Season with very
little salt, always depending on how salty the cheese is, but use
plenty of black pepper, freshly ground, and a touch of nutmeg.  Then
pour in the Kirsch, stir steadily and invite guests to dunk their
forked bread in the dish or in a smaller preheated casserole over a
low electric or alcohol burner on the dining table.  The trick is to
keep the bubbling melted cheese in rhythmic motion with the fork, both
up and down and around and around.
