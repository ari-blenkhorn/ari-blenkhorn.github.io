<b>Pastry</b>

<menu>
    1 lb. phyllo dough<br>
    2 cups finely chopped pistachios<br>
    1/2 lb. sweet butter<p>
</menu>

Preheat oven to 325F.  Melt butter.  Grease 11" x 16" baking pan
(jelly roll pan with 1" high sides).  Lay 1 sheet phyllo on pan
and brush generously with butter.  (If the sheet doesn't fit
exactly that's okay.  If too long in one dimension just fold the
excess over and butter.  Alternate sides with the next sheet.  If
too short in one dimension just cover exposed area with next
sheet, alternating sides with alternate sheets.)  Continue with
second sheet, etc., until all of the sheets have been used.  Spread
nuts evenly over the entire surface.  Add the rest of the sheets
and butter.  Pour remaining butter over the top.  Cut into
diagonal strips to form diamonds.  Bake 1/2 hour at 325F.  Reduce
heat to 250F and bake 1 hour.<p>

<b>Syrup</b>

<menu>
    3 cups sugar<br>
    2 tablespoons honey<br>
    2 cups apricot juice (canned apricot nectar works)<br>
    1 tablespoons lemon juice<p>
</menu>

Combine all ingredients in a sauce pan.  Bring to a boil and then
reduce heat and simmer to a heavy syrup, 20-25 minutes.  Drain excess
butter from pastry.  Brush surface lightly with butter.  Pour warm
syrup over pastry a little at a time until all is absorbed.  Allow to
cool several hours.  Makes 30 diamonds.
