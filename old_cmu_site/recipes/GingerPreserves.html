Peel green ginger roots and lay in cold water for 15 min., then boil,
changing the water twice, until very tender.  Drain ginger and weigh it
before laying it in iced water.  Allow 1 1/4 lb. of sugar to each
lb. ginger.  Wet each lb. sugar wih a cup of water and put the sugar and
water into the preserving kettle.  Boil and skim until the scum ceases
to rise, then remove syrup from fire and set aside until cold.  Wipe
each piece of ginger and lay it in the cold syrup.  Stand for 24 hrs.,
drain the ginger and reheat syrup.  Take from fire again and when
blood-warm put in the ginger.  Leave it for two days.  Then take out
ginger roots at once.  Now set aside for a week before draining the
ginger once more.  Boil syrup, drop in ginger and put in jars.  Do not
use for one month.

down until thick.  Seal immediately.  Add spices if desired.
