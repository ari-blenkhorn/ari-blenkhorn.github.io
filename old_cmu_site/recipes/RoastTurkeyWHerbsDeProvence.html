<!-- on your level of anal-retentiveness.  :-)  -->

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.  Remove any pin feathers from turkey, and
wash & dry inside &out.  Cut lemon in half and rub inside of bird with
one of the halves, squeezing out juice as you rub.  Place both lemon
halves inside turkey.  cut a celery stalk into 1" pieces and quarter
an onion.  combine with salt, garlic, parsley, and 2 tsp herbes de
provence.  Place mixture inside bird.  Sprinkle half the remaining
herbes in the neck opening.  Truss by tying the wings close to the
body and legs together.  Rub the outside of the turkey with the olive
oil and remaining herbes.  Lay turkey, breast side down, on a rack and
set in roasting pan.  Slice remaining celery and onion and add to pan.
Add boiling water.  Bake 30 minutes.  Turn turkey on its side, baste with
pan juices, and bake 45 minutes.  Turn on its other side, baste and bake
30 minutes more.  Turn turkey breast side up, baste and bake for another
45-60 minutes, basting once or twice more.  to test for doneness, insert
an instant-read thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh, without
touching bone.  The thermometer should register 180 degrees.  Transfer
turkey to a hot platter, cover loosely with foil, and let rest at
least 15 minutes before carving.
