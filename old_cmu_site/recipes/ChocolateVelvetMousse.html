<menu>
    12 oz semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate, cut into bits<br>
    2 tsp powdered instant coffee (not freeze-dried), dissolved in 1/4 c water<br>
    1/4 c Curacao or rum<br>
    2 egg yolks<br>
    4 egg whites, at room temperature<br>
    1/4 tsp cream of tartar<br>
    2 Tbsp sugar<br>
    1/2 c heavy cream<p>
</menu>
 <!--LATEX \vspace*{-.2cm} -->
Melt chocolate, dissolved coffee, and Curacao or rum in a medium
bowl set in a barely simmering pan of water.  Stir frequently to
hasten melting.  Or, melt in a microwave on medium (50%) for about
2:15.  Stir until smooth.  When mixture is warm and smooth, whisk in
egg yolks and combine well.  Remove from heat and set aside. <P>

In a clean, dry mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on
medium speed until soft peaks form.  Gradually sprinkle in 2 tbsp
sugar, beating on high speed until stiff but not dry.  Fold one-fourth
of the egg whites into chocolate mixture to lighten it.  Scrape all of
the remaining whites on top of mousse and set aside while you beat the
cream.  Beat cream until it holds its shape softly (do not beat until
stiff). <P>

Scrape whipped cream over egg whites and chocolate.  Fold together
until just incorporated.  Turn the mousse immediately into lined mold
or serving bowls.
