<menu>
a 3/4-pound seedless piece butternut squash, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch dice (about 5 cups)<BR>1 medium onion, unpeeled, cut into eighths<BR>
1 large garlic clove, unpeeled<BR>
1 tablespoon vegetable oil<BR>
eight 5- to 6-inch flour tortillas<BR>
1 cup chopped red bell pepper (about 1 large)<BR>
1 cup coarsely grated jack cheese<BR>
1/2 stick (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened<P>

<p>
Preheat oven to 400&#176;F.
<p>
In a shallow baking pan arrange squash, onion, and garlic in one layer
and drizzle with oil, tossing to coat. Roast mixture in middle of oven
15 minutes, or until garlic is tender and transfer garlic to a work
surface. Roast squash and onion until tender, about 15 minutes
more. Discard peels from squash, onion, and garlic.
<p>
In a food processor pur&#233;e squash, onion and garlic with salt and
pepper to taste until smooth. Squash pur&#233;e may be made 2 days
ahead and chilled, covered.
<p>
Spread about one fourth squash pur&#233;e on each of 4 tortillas and
sprinkle each with about one fourth bell pepper and about one fourth
cheese. Top each quesadilla with a plain tortilla, pressing gently
together. Spread each side of quesadillas with 1/2 tablespoon
butter.
<p>
Heat a griddle or 7-inch non-stick skillet over moderately high heat
until hot and cook quesadillas, 1 at a time, until golden, about 3
minutes on each side, transferring to a cutting board.
<p>
Cut each quesadilla into 6 to 8 wedges and serve warm with chipotle
dip.
