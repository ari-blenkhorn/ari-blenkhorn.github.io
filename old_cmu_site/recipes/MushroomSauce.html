<menu>
    1/2 oz imported dried porcini mushrooms<br>
    1 cup warm water<br>
    2 lbs small, firm white mushrooms<br>
    6 Tbsp olive oil<br>
    2 Tbsp finely chopped onion<br>
    1 clove garlic, minced<br>
    1 Tbsp freshly chopped Italian parsley<br>
    1/4 tsp dried savory<br>
    1 tsp salt<br>
    1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper<br>
    2 Tbsp tomato paste<br>
    1/2 c dry white wine<p>
</menu>

Soak dried mushrooms in 1 cup of warm water for 10 minutes.  Lift them
with a fork, reserving the water.  Remove and discard any parts which
still have sand attached and coarsely chop.  Wash, drain, and thinly
slice the fresh mushrooms.  Place oil, onion, garlic, parsley, savory,
salt, and pepper in a saucepan, and saute for 1/2 minute.  Add the two
mushrooms and cook over moderately high heat for 5 minutes, stirring
frequently.  Add tomato paste and wine and cook over high heat,
stirring, until the alcohol has evaporated -- about 2 minutes.  Add
the reserved water from the soaked mushrooms, taking care not to
include any sand that might remain at the bottom of the cup.  Cook
over high heat 5 minutes longer or until liquid is greatly reduced.
