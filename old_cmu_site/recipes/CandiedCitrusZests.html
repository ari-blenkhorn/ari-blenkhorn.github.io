    1-2 bright-skinned oranges, lemons, or limes, preferably organic<br>
    1/2 cup sugar<p>
</menu>


 Use a vegetable peeler to remove the zest (colored part of the
skin only) from the fruit in pieces as long and wide as possible.  To
obtain the longest &amp; widest pieces, hold the fruit against the
counter and start peeling from the stem end toward the opposite end of
the fruit.  Bear down firmly with the peeler and move the blade back
and forth (as though you were cutting with a knife) ever so slightly
as you work your way from one end of the fruit to the other. <P>

 Pile 2-3 pieces of zest one on top of another.  Slice diagonally
into fine julienne about 1 1/2 to 2 inches long.  Shorten or lengthen
the julienne by varying the angle of your diagonal slice. <P>

 Combine sugar and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan.  Stir just
to moisten sugar.  Cover and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for about 30
seconds, just to dissolve sugar.  Add the julienned zest, cover, and
simmer for 2 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Uncover and let the zest
cool in the syrup.  Candied zests can be made and stored in the syrup
in a jar, in the refrigerator, for at least 3 months.  Remove from
syrup and drain on a paper towel before using.
