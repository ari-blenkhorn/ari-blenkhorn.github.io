<menu>
    1 medium-size flower pot (about 8 inches in diameter works well, or use two small pots about 6 inches in diameter)<br>
    1 garden trowel<br>
    3 large gummy or plastic worms<br>
    plastic flowers<br>
    1 16-ounce bag Oreo cookies<br>
    1/2 cup (1 stick) butter or margarine, softened<br>
    1 8-ounce package cream cheese, softened<br>
    1 cup confectioners' sugar<br>
    1 teaspoon vanilla<br>
    2 4-serving-size boxes instant chocolate-fudge flavor pudding<br>
    3 cups milk<br>
    1 12-ounce tub whipped topping, thawed<p>
</menu>

Crush cookies until they resemble potting soil, set aside.
Cream butter, cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth and
fluffy.  Set aside. Combine pudding mix and milk until well
blended, then fold in the whipped topping.  Gently fold cream cheese
and pudding mixtures together. <P>

To put the cake together, layer 1/3 of the cookie crumbs followed
by 1/2 the pudding mixture, 1/3/ of the crumbs, the rest of the
pudding mixture and topping with the remaining cookie crumbs.
Refrigerate 10 to 12 hours.  About 1/2 hour before serving, remove
from refrigerator and decorate with flowers.  Serve by digging out
portions with the trowel.
