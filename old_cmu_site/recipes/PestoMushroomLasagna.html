   seem too large or too small, use your judgement.  I'll try to correct
   this file when I try this recipe myself.</i><p>

<menu>
<b>Pesto sauce</b><br>
    1 bunch of spinach, cleaned and destemmed<br>
    2 large bunches of basil cleaned and destemmed<br>
    2-3 cloves of garlic<br>
    ~ 1 tsp hazelnut oil<br>
    ~ 1/4 cup olive oil<br>
    a little lemon juice<br>
    ~ 1/2 cup of water<p>
</menu>


Blend this well, adding a little bit of spinach or basil at a time.
You want it to be about the consistency of tomato sauce.  Set it
aside, then clean your blender or food processor.
<p>

<menu>
<b>Mushroom sauce</b><br>
    1/2-1 lb sliced mushrooms<br>
    3-4 Tbsp butter<br>
    2-3 cups milk<br>
    1-2 Tbsp flour<br>
    dried bits of chantrelles (optional)<br>
    splash of red wine<p>
</menu>

Saute mushrooms in 2-3 Tbsp butter. Cook them long and slowly until
they're well cooked but don't cook out all the juices.  Move the
mushrooms to the blender and puree.  Add a little milk as necessary.
Use the left over mushroom juice in the pan and remaining butter to
make a roux with flour.  Add milk to make a white sauce.  Add the
mushroom puree, and chantrelles if desired. Add wine.  Cook slowly
until it's thickened.  Should be about as thick as the pesto, maybe a
little thicker.
<p>

<menu>
<b>Baked garlic</b><br>
    2 heads of garlic<br>
    olive oil<p>
</menu>

Peel and chop in half 2 heads worth of garlic cloves.  Put in a casserole
dish, cover well with olive oil and bake until a little browned on top and
cooked through.  Bake at about 350F.  Should take 20-40 minutes.
<p>

<b>The Lasagna</b>
<menu>
    large container of ricotta<br>
    2 lbs (or a little less) of grated Mozzarella<br>
    1 package montrachet or other soft goats milk cheese. (optional)<br>
    4 sheets of fresh pasta (these are 12"x12" sheets) or slightly cooked regular lasagna noodles.<br>  
    1 cup toasted, skinned, chopped hazelnuts.<p>
</menu>

Preheat your oven to 350F. Cut the noodles to fit a 9x13 (standard
large) glass baking dish.<p>

Layer in this order:<br>
<menu>
    pesto sauce<br>
    noodles<br>
    ricotta and montrachet<br>
    noodles<br>
    mushroom sauce (use it all unless it's too much)<br>
    baked garlic<br>
    noodles<br>
    Mozzarella and hazelnuts<br>
    noodles<br>
    pesto sauce<br>
    noodles<br>
    ricotta and montrachet<br>
    noodles<br>
    pesto sauce and Mozzarella and hazelnuts<p>
</menu>

This should fill the pan.  If you're using fresh sheets of pasta, don't cut
them into pieces other than just to fit them in the pan. Use lots of sauce
in the layers since the sauce is what cooks the noodles.
<p>
Bake for 30-40 minutes until slightly browned on top.  If you bake it a
little long (which is fine) it'll probably puff up and really looks
spectacular when it comes to the table.  It can also sit for 30 minutes or
so and still be fine.
