<menu>
    1 lb granulated sugar<br>
    1/2 pint water<br>
    4 Tbsp vinegar (clear)<br>
    3 Tbsp golden syrup<br>
    1/2 tsp baking soda, sifted<br>
    12 oz. chocolate chips<br>
    2 Tbsp vegetable shortening<br>
    1 (1 oz. square unsweetened baking chocolate<p>
</menu>

Butter or oil an 8" square tin; set aside. <P>

 Put sugar, vinegar, syrup, and water in a heavy saucepan (cast
iron if you have it).  Be careful that your pot is big enough, because
sugar has a tendency to boil over. Gently heat the mixture, stirring
with a wooden spoon, until sugar has dissolved & syrup has
melted. Bring to a boil, cover & boil for 3 minutes, then uncover and
boil until temperature reaches 285-degrees F on a candy thermometer. <P>

 Remove from heat & stir in the baking soda, mixing well to allow
bubbles to subside a little. <b>CAUTION</b>: once you add the baking soda the
mixture WILL bubble up quite a bit. Again, make sure your pot is large
enough or it will bubble over the sides. The baking soda is what gives
it its light airy texture. <P>

 Pour into oiled tin & leave until just beginning to set. Mark
into squares with a lightly oiled knife. Leave to set completely. Cut
or break into pieces. <P>

 Combine chocolate chips, shortening & baking chocolate in 2-quart
glass micro-proof bowl.  Microwave on HIGH 2 minutes.  Using wooden
spoon, stir through to melt. <P>

 Dip honeycomb pieces into chocolate, covering completely.  Let
cool on waxed paper.  Wrap individually in waxed paper, twisting the
ends together, and store in an airtight container.
