<!-- Directions.  Can be paragraphs or a numbered list, depending -->
<!-- on your level of anal-retentiveness.  :-)  -->

Separate the leaves of the lettuce, discarding any tough or discolored
outer ones.  Wash and dry thoroughly.  Tear large leaves in half, and
place in a salad bowl.  Slice Parmesan into very thin shavings, using
a vegetable peeler or specialty slicer.  Scatter cheese over lettuce.
Sprinkle with balsamic vinegar and salt, and toss well.  Drizzle with
oil and toss again.  Serve immediately.
