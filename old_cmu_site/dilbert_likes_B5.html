In the Jan. 11th issue of TV Guide there's a tonge-in-cheek article, "Why
Dilbert Loves TV".  B5 gets a blurb and picture. "Dilbert" comments as
follows:

"This is the best television show ever made.  It's too complicated for the
average viewer to understand without reading the Babylon 5 web pages
first.  And I respect that in a show.  Plus the stars get to have sex with
aliens.  That really opens up your options"

Obviously, Scott Adams(Dilbert's creator) is a fan of the show.  Cool.
