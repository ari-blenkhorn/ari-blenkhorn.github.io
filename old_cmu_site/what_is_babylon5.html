This is off Usenet, but not posted to the moderated group, so you
wouldn't see it, normally.  The author is Peronet Despeignes.
<p>
A couple references:  JMS is the author and Lord High Creator of
the show.  "Lurkers" refers to people who read the Lurker's Guide
(http://www.hyperion.com/lurk/), the primary B5 reference guide.
And there are a few episode titles in there:  Severed Dreams,
The Long Twilight Struggle, ...

<hr>

..The important thing is this: at its best, B5 consistently
exhibits an attention to detail and a respect for the tragic
elements of life that ST,for all of its improvements over the last
season, too often fails to represent. I suspect B5, like TOS
before it, will not only survive but transcend its shortcomings
and thrive in spite of them. Here's why...
<p>
At its best, B5 represents an uncertainty about how much worse
things will get rather than a comfortable belief in things
eventually returning to normal over smiles, quiet laughs and hot
cocoa after the battle's over. It's about slowly wading through
the thick muck of ugly tensions instead of backslaps and
handshakes between the warring parties when an individual episode
comes to an end. It's something beyond antiseptic portrayals of 
main characters visibly confident that they'll survive the season
no matter what happens.
<p>
B5 is not about 
two-ships-passing-in-the-night-firing-slow-intermittent-glorified-cannonballs-at-one-another.
Its about several swarms of metallic worker bees degenerating
from fixed formations into chaotic interactions along three
dimensions.
<p>
B5 is a relentless barrage of painful hesitations, difficult
judgements,terrible miscalculations, aborted detentes, paralyzing
fears and grudging resignation to the demands of necessity. It's a
man biting his lower lip as he pulls the trigger.
<p>
B5 is a long, drawn out camera pan over a landscape of battered
carcasses at the end of an undesired firefight; B5 is a
confrontation between an organized conspiracy of insecurity and a
disorganized, insecure conspiracy of competing interests; B5 is a
council leader whose gesture of greeting is welcomed with weapons
fire; B5 is a dying emperor and a targeted president entertaining
wild and pretentious ambitions of a peace neither will survive; B5
is a command staff in command of very little, anxious, confused,
bewildered, in mild disarray; B5 is a head of security unable to
protect himself; B5 is a medical officer suffering from an
illness he cannot treat; B5 is an ambassador and a people wildly
chasing vague hopes of an elusive grandeur to will fill the voids
of moral decay; B5 is an ambassador whose efforts at strengthening
the ties that bind two species are rewarded with the scorn of
both; B5 is a war-hardened diplomat-soldier cowering like a baby
against the wall of a hallway, tears in his eyes, fragile hopes
betrayed, disheveled, demoralized...angry;  B5 is a submissive,
hesitant and otherwise insignificant subordinate with a rare 
courage to vainly declare the unspoken, mitigate the irreprable,
and speak to the face of an enemy the words "I'm sorry."
<p>
B5 is about the death of important characters; it's about the
lingering threat of impending death hovering over *all* of the
main characters *all*of the time; it's about people succumbing to
petty selfishness; its about consequences, repercussions, enduring
tensions, irony, things going bad just when characters thought
they couldn't get any worse. It's about quasi-protagonists who,
more often than not, act as recalcitrant puppets reluctantly
dancing to the tune of forces beyond their control. It's about the
frayed-yet-sturdy conviction of an individual where institutions
have failed. It's about the universe as you once knew it going
straight to hell.
<p>
It's about the primacy of fear, prejudice and self-interest over
last-ditch, heartfelt appeals to reason, open-mindedness and
sacrifice for the greater good. Its the loud, united thunderclap
of euphoria celebrating a signed treaty contrasted with the quiet,
lonely sobs signalling the wake of its failure. Its about dealing
with life as it is, not life as we wish it could be or life as we
may have once envisioned it. B5 is about severed dreams-- the
death of grandiose visions-- and the effort to adjust and build
new ones. B5 is about the turmoil of the human condition and the
struggle to transcend it- about a long twilight struggle against
the lesser angels of our nature.
<p>
Make no mistake. B5 is no "line drawn against the darkness;" it
is no "line in the sand" drawn against some dark and nefarious
nemesis, some well-defined and unabashedly evil enemy, some clear,
present and external danger.
<p>
B5 is a near-hopeless holding action against the bland and
indifferent avalanche of inevitability. B5 won't die. Babylonians,
armed with weapons of telecommunication that TOS viewers and
Roddenberry himself could have only dreamed of, simply wont let
that happen. Any possibility of cancellation would engender a
viewer movement for reinstatement unseen in the world of
television since...say...the 1960s when the first ST series was
experiencing some of the same travails. B5's strength is beyond 
numbers, beyond ratings, beyond pragmatic and jaundiced
assessments of its commercial viability.
<p>
It's bigger than you.  It's bigger than all of us.  Frankly, it's
bigger than JMS, himself.
<p>
This is about an immense yearning (however inchoate) heretofore
untapped, for a serious, organic, well-integrated, meaningful,
realistic portrayal of the struggle of life with sci-fi as the
metaphor, vehicle and medium. This is about the exploration of
archetypes that have helped us to define the human condition. This
is about a sci-fi novel with moving pictures. It's a deliberate
focus on the painful duality of human nature and the incredible
darkness underlying it.
<p>
It is not about a mere agglomeration of television episodes or
some line-item on a ratings list or about a mere collection of
aliases on an internet newsgroup or about some staff stationed in
Hollywood.This is a leviathan, immensely bigger than the sum of
its parts.
<p>
My fellow Lurkers, this...thing...is alive.
