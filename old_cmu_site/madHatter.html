<LI> What Is It? <P>

MadHatterDay is a holiday in October.  It fills the  need  for  a
second  crazy  day  in  the year, almost exactly half a year from
April Fools' Day. The real spirit of MadHatterDay  is  turnabout:
The  nonsense  we  usually  have to pretend is sane can be called
madness for one day in the year; the superficially  crazy  things
that really make sense can be called sane on MadHatterDay.<P>

MadHatterDay is 10/6.  The date was chosen from the illustrations by
John Tenniel in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, wherein the Mad
Hatter is always seen wearing a hat bearing a slip of paper with the
notation "In this style 10/6".  We take this as inspiration to behave
in the style of the Mad Hatter on 10/6 (which is October 6 here,
although in Britain MadHatterDay occurs on June 10...but I digress...)
Some astute observers have noted that the paper in the Mad Hatter's
Hat was really an order to make a hat in the style shown, to cost ten
shillings sixpence.  However, it is well known that Time Is Money, and
therefore Money Is Time, and therefore 10/6 may as well be the sixth
of October.<P>

MadHatterDay began in Boulder, CO, in 1986, among some computer folk
who had nothing better to do.  It was immediately recognized as
valuable because they caused less damage than if they'd been doing
their jobs.  It was announced that first year on computer networks. In
1987 it gained minor local recognition.  In 1988, it was first
recognized as an official holiday by an area business, and also
received its first national press coverage by news services (who are
always desperate for an unlikely story).  It is almost certain that
the national election also gave MadHatterDay a good boost in 1988.<P>

Detailed plans for this year's MadHatterDay observance will, of
course, be announced on October 7.  We have found that plans made
after the fact are more accurate and much easier to have fulfilled.
Or, as the Red Queen said, "sentence first, then the verdict!"<P>


<LI>What Goes?<P>

What do people do on MadHatterDay?  In general, we celebrate
silliness.  But what if your work involves something inherently
silly -- say marketing, where you put on a three-piece suit (five or six
layers of fabric) in the summertime, tie a piece of cloth around your
neck to restrict blood flow to the brain, and set about trying to
convince people to buy things they don't want and can't afford because
this will give the country a Healthy Economy?  In this case, doing
something absolutely sane will have a more startling effect than you
can possibly imagine.<P>

Your world is crazier than you think:<P>
<UL>

<LI>We travel around by taking the juice from hundred-million-year-old
rotten dinosaur food and exploding it in a metal can.<P>

<LI>A "sports fanatic" is not someone who participates in sports, but
someone who sits indoors on a beautiful day, drinking beer while
yelling at the picture on a little box. (Throw the ultimate football
party: Forget the TV; just sit around eating and drinking with
friends.)<P>

<LI>As much as we say we like to "get away from it all", the more
successful we are, the more we take it all with us when we go.  (Take
a vacation with all the comforts of home: Just stay home!)<P>

<LI>We're so well-fed that we're getting food with intentionally
reduced nutritional content--so we can take the trouble to eat without
getting the benefit of doing so.  (Enjoy the ultimate in
fast-diet-food: Skip lunch.)<P>

<LI>We've saved so much gift-giving for the Christmas season that it
has entirely unbalanced the flow of cash and consu mer goods through
the year.  So merchants decided to start the season early to have
something to do the rest of the year.  (There's now only one major
gift-giving holiday -- but it lasts for five months.  Surprise someone
with a MadHatterDay present.)<P>

</UL>
...and it goes.  Take a look around you,  drop  your  assumptions
about  what  must be proper and normal, and see how much of it is
just silly.  Better yet, try to find  something  that  does  make
sense.<P>

Don't hurt anyone.  Save the pranks for April 1.
This is "a Kinder, Gentler Fool's Day."<P>

And it's the day after Ari Rapkin's birthday.  What better excuse?
