<H1>Positive mutations</H1>

I've been fascinated by slips and typos like these for a long time,
but in a lecture by Daniel Dennett (at the University of Virginia in
Spring 1995) I finally found a wonderful metaphoric description for
them.  Think of the effect of changing a single nucleotide in a DNA
strand.  Most often it makes no difference (DNA has many redundant
encodings).  If it does make a difference, usually it's negative.  But
once in a while, the mutation has a positive effect, and the result is
preserved.

Now, consider the same thing occurring in a long string of letters,
instead of nucleotides.
<p>
The Washington Post's "Style Invitational" invited readers to construct
humorous "slips", although their rules were slightly different:  add,
subtract or change one letter, and supply a new definition.

[Winners]</a>
  The list below contains some "positive
mutations" that I've encountered.

<UL>
<LI>My absolute favorite, from a colleague at Industrial Light & Magic:
<BR>
<i>
I need to make a short (2-3 min) film of a spider for
an opera production.
<br>
If you have a nice big scary one,
I'd love to immoralize it on film.
</i>
<P>
<LI>
From another colleague at ILM, about ILM's proposed move to a new location,
and the fact that we're one of four companies submitting plans
for the property:<br>
<i>
does [it] seem that this company is more of a shoe in
than the others?
</i>
<br>
Hmm, perhaps the new space is so small that we'll need a shoehorn to fit
everyone in?  (She meant <i>shoo in</i>.)
<P>

<LI>Seen on a package of bookcase-anchoring devices (so your bookcase
doesn't topple over during an earthquake) for sale at Home Depot:
"<i>Provides discrete protection...</i>".  I'd rather it provide 
<i>continuous</i> protection, wouldn't you?  (They meant <i>discreet</i>.)
<p>
<LI>In response to a question about landlord-tenant disputes,
the writer recommended picking up a particular reference book at
<i>Boarder's</i> bookstore.
<p>
<LI>
The author of some lecture notes about digital media turned an
<i>
audio stream
</i>
into a whistling tea kettle 
(<i>audio steam</i>).
<P>
<LI>
<i>
Parctising my talk one more time before I head over.
</i>
To get the joke here, you have to know that the talk was to be given
at <a href="http://www.parc.xerox.com">Xerox <i>PARC</i></a>.
<P>
<LI>
<i>
I am now firmly convinced that your parents were causal aquaintances.<br>
</i>
Posted on rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.* (speaking to JMS) on 6 Dec 1996.  Yes,
I'd have to say that they were the cause and he's the effect.  And I'm
not saying that <i>casually</i>.
<P>
<LI>
<i>
I thought I'd lull you into a fall sense of security.<br>
</i>
Posted on rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.* on 9 Nov 1996... so maybe it's a
<i>winter</i> sense of security instead?
<P>
<LI>
<i>
The wife of man is nasty, brutish, and short.<br>
</i>
The original, by Hobbes, was "the life...".  I can't remember the author of
the mutated version.
<P>
<LI>In a rec.humor.funny post (15 April 1995) about an "Internet
Poster's License", the writer suggests that
<i>
Depending on state law,
one might also have to provide proof of libelity insurance.
</i>
Did he mean "liability" or was "libel" deliberate?  Either way, the
premium's gonna be costly.

<P>
<LI>Describing how a program crashed and core-dumped, the writer
intended to say 
<i>
most horrible
</i>
but instead produced
<i>
mort horrible
</i>
-- a fine description of the way his program died.
<P>

<LI>
<i>
Mazel tov
</i>
, meaning "congratulations", or literally, "good
thing", became
<i>
mazel ton
</i>
, meaning perhaps "may a ton of good things happen".  For a whole
list of this kind of one-letter-changed inter-language pun, click
<A HREF="Fractured.html">here</A>.
<P>
<LI>
Recently, I've seen several examples of a general class of slips:
authors confuse 
words that end in <i>ents</i> with related words ending in <i>ence</i>.
<br>
<ul>
<li>All the <i>residence</i> of the small town were very friendly.
<li>This takes <i>precedents</i> over all other questions.
</ul>
And a related error:
<ul>
<li>For all <i>intensive</i> purposes...  (should be <i>intents 
and</i>)
</ul>
</UL>
<p>
I'm also amused by the phrases that folks come up with when they hear
words they don't understand.  This happens most often when a
journalist interviews someone about a topic unfamiliar to the
journalist.  The technical terms get mangled in sometimes-humorous ways.
<P>
Examples:
<UL>
<LI>At a public hearing on tidal marsh restoration, 
a refererence to
<i>
"tidal prism"
</i>
(the total volume of water that moves in and out on the tides)
was recorded by the court reporter as
<i>
"tidal prison".
</i>
The inmates of this prison are probably rather "crabby"!
<P>
<LI>The computer hacker who was reported as
<i>
cracking route
</i>
(i.e. he
got the ROOT password).
<BR>New York Times, 27 Feb 1995.  
<P>
<LI>Rutgers University's new laser-based tool for diagnosing ulcers
doesn't run away.  At least, that's what the journalist who turned
<i>
non-invasive
</i>
into 
<i>
non-evasive
</i>
thinks.
<BR> Reuters, 27 Feb 1995.
</UL>
And it's not limited to journalists writing about technology...
<P>
<UL>
<LI>In a for-sale newsgroup posting, someone advertised a bunch of
kitchen gadgets, including a
<i>
pearing knife
</i>
.  Now, I've heard Miss Manners mention fruit knives, but I
didn't realize there were different kinds for specific fruits!  (Okay,
maybe I should have realized, given that grape scissors exist...)
